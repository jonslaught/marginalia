 I was on an airplane last night as the election was decided.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="4">
 As the plane landed after midnight on the East Coast, I confess that my hand was shaking as I turned on my phone for the news.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="3">
 I did not want to see dishonesty and divisiveness and raw political hackery rewarded.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="2">
 It is hard enough for anyone to actually address the problems, to move this country forward, to make the intransigent American ruling class yield even a yard of the past to the inevitable future.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="1">
 But going backwards last night would have been devastating.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="0">
 I read the returns in silent elation; a business trip had me traveling in business class and the gnashing of corporate teeth all around precluded a full-throated huzzah on my part.
</span>
I abhor a gloat.
</p>
<p>
But the country is changing.
<span class="marker" id="8">
 And this may be the last election in which anyone but a fool tries to play &mdash; on a national level, at least &mdash; the cards of racial exclusion, of immigrant fear, of the patronization of women and hegemony over their bodies, of self-righteous discrimination against homosexuals.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="7">
 Some in the Republican party and among the teabagged fringe will continue to play such losing hands for some time to come; this shit worked well in its day and distracted many from addressing any of our essential national issues.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="6">
 But again, if they play that weak-ass game past this point, they are fools.
</span>
</p>
<p>

 America is different now, more so with every election cycle.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="13">
 Ronald Reagan won his mandate in an America in which 89 percent of the voters were white.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="12">
 That number is down to 72 percent and falling.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="11">
 Fifty thousand new Latino citizens achieve the voting age every month.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="10">
 America will soon belong to the men and women &mdash; white and black and Latino and Asian, Christian and Jew and Muslim and atheist, gay and straight &mdash; who can walk into a room and accept with real comfort the sensation that they are in a world of certain difference, that there are no real majorities, only pluralities and coalitions.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="9">
 The America in which it was otherwise is dying, thank god, and those who relied on entitlement and division to command power will either be obliged to accept the changes, or retreat to the gated communities from which they wish to wax nostalgic and brood on political irrelevance.
</span>
</p>
<p>
You want to lead in America?
<span class="marker" id="18">
 Find a way to be entirely utilitarian &mdash; to address the most problems on behalf of the most possible citizens.
</span>
That works. That matters.
<span class="marker" id="17">
 Last night, it mattered just enough to overcome the calcified political calculations of men who think that 47 percent will vote against them because they are victims, or that 53 percent are with them because the rest of us vote only from self-interest and without regard for the republic as a whole.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="16">
 It was a closer contest than common sense and the spirit of a truly great nation should dictate.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="15">
 But unless these white guys who have peddled &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for so long &mdash; normal as in racial majority, normal as in religious majority, normal as in sexual orientation &mdash; unless they have a hard moment of self-reflection and self-awareness, well, it will not be this close again.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="20">
 Eighty years ago, the Democratic party became a national utilitarian enterprise, molding the immigrant waves of Irish and Italian and Jew into a voting bloc that stunned the political opposition and transformed American society, creating the world&rsquo;s greatest economic engine in the form of a consumer class with vast discretionary income.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="19">
 The New Deal asserted for American progress &mdash; shaping and influencing administrations both Democratic and Republican &mdash; for three decades before running aground on the shoals of the civil rights movement, resulting racial fears and resentments, and, of course, the Southern strategy of political cynics.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="25">
 Well, a new voting bloc as formidable as the New Deal coalition certainly isn&rsquo;t yet complete, and the political results are still fitful.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="24">
 To be sure, venality has transformed the upper house of our national legislature into a paralytic failure, with a new standard of a filibuster-proof supermajority now the norm.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="23">
 The lower house of that legislature reflects less of any national consensus than it does the absurdity of post-census gerrymandering.
</span>
Never mind Obama.
<span class="marker" id="22">
 If Romney had won this election, our government would be just as broken.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="21">
 It is the legislative branch that remains an epic systems failure.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="29">
 For lost and fretful white men, unwilling to accept the terms of a new America, Congress is the last barricade against practical and inevitable change.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="28">
 But there, too, the demographic inevitabilities are all in play.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="27">
 All the gerrymandering in this world won&rsquo;t make those other Americans, those different Americans, go away.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="26">
 And the tyranny of minority and lack of compromise that you employ to thwart progress now will likely breed an equal contempt when the demographics do indeed provide supermajorities.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="38">
 Hard times are still to come for all of us.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="37">
 Rear guard actions will be fought at every political crossroad.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="36">
 But make no mistake: Change is a motherfucker when you run from it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="35">
 And right now, the conservative movement in America is fleeing from dramatic change that is certain and immutable.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="34">
 A man of color is president for the second time, and this happened despite a struggling economic climate and a national spirit of general discontent.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="33">
 He has been returned to office over the specific objections of the mass of white men.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="32">
 He has instead been re-elected by women, by people of color, by homosexuals, by people of varying religions or no religion whatsoever.
</span>
Behold the New Jerusalem.
<span class="marker" id="31">
 Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with being a white man, of course.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="30">
 There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being anything.
</span>
That&rsquo;s the point.
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="44">
 This election marks a moment in which the racial and social hierarchy of America is upended forever.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="43">
 No longer will it mean more politically to be a white male than to be anything else.
</span>
Evolve, or don&rsquo;t.
<span class="marker" id="42">
 Swallow your resentments, or don&rsquo;t.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="41">
 But the votes are going to be counted, more of them with each election.
</span>
Arizona will soon be in play.
<span class="marker" id="40">
 And in a few cycles, even Texas.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="39">
 And those wishing to hold national office in these United States will find it increasingly useless to argue for normal, to attempt to play one minority against each other, to turn pluralities against the feared &ldquo;other&rdquo; of gays, or blacks, or immigrants, or, incredibly in this election cycle, our very wives and lovers and daughters, fellow citizens who demand to control their own bodies.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="50">
 Regardless of what happens with his second term, Barack Obama&rsquo;s great victory has already been won: We are all the other now, in some sense.
</span>
Special interests?
<span class="marker" id="49">
 That term has no more meaning in the New America.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="48">
 We are all &mdash; all of us, every last American, even the whitest of white guys &mdash; special interests.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="47">
 And now, normal isn&rsquo;t white or straight or Christian.
</span>
There is no normal.
<span class="marker" id="46">
 That word, too, means less with every moment.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="45">
 And those who continue to argue for such retrograde notions as a political reality will become less germane and more ridiculous with every passing year.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="52">
 Lots of waste and shouting and ignorance still to come, of course.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="51">
 But last night was a milestone.

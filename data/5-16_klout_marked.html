<span class="marker" id="7">
 Five years ago, Joe Fernandez, at 30, had jaw surgery.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="6">
 His mouth was wired shut for three months and he couldn&rsquo;t carry on a conversation.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="5">
 He immersed himself in the online world, and realized that unlike every other form of broadcast media there was no way to measure the impact of its key element&mdash;people.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="4">
 There were countless communicators who had online sway, people worth taking note of.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="3">
 But many were unsung and unmeasured.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="2">
 He decided to quantify that influence.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="13">
 Now he has a reasonably successful Internet company called Klout.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="12">
 It uses data from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Google+, Blogger and other sources to boil down influence to a single number on a scale of a 100.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="11">
 (Until recently Justin Bieber had a perfect score.) Millions of people check how they&rsquo;re doing on Klout.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="10">
 Sponsors give freebies to high-scoring Klouters to spread word of mouth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="9">
 (Latest: free access to American Airlines Admirals Club.) Investors have poured an estimated $40 million into the company.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="8">
 A story in Wired last year said Klout is &ldquo;at the forefront of a new and extremely promising online industry.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="14">
 But Joe Fernandez knows it&rsquo;s not enough.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="20">
 He sees Klout&rsquo;s mission as empowering people to maximize their influence.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="19">
 So far, though, the service has mostly been about quantifying and reporting.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="18">
 People visit the site not to do anything, but to ego-surf.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="17">
 (&ldquo;You feel somewhat dirty,&rdquo; Fernandez admits.) He wants to change that&mdash;by making Klout much more than just a yardstick to measuring influence.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="16">
 &ldquo;I want to do something important on the Internet,&rdquo; he says.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="15">
 (Quickly adding that he doesn&rsquo;t mean that scoring influence isn&rsquo;t, um, important.)
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="23">
 Perhaps more to the point, there&rsquo;s only so far Klout can go in a business sense by simply being a scorekeeper.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="22">
 There&rsquo;s persistent skepticism about the relevance of boiling down online influence to a single number.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="21">
 A recent study by NYU Stern School assistant professor Sinan Aral found that &ldquo;traditional models overestimated the power of influence by a factor of seven.&rdquo; Aral reports that while most of his students follow Ashton Kutcher on Twitter, almost none of them have ever done anything @aplusk suggested.
</span>
</p>
<p>
Solution?
<span class="marker" id="24">
 The scorekeeper wants to get in the game.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="26">
 So as of today, Klout is conducting something of a pivot.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="25">
 Klout scores will still be around, but the site is transmogrifying into a service where people can get questions answered by experts.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="32">
 In other words, Klout is vying for status as a social network itself, not just a place that scores other networks.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="31">
 It&rsquo;s as if the Nielsen Company suddenly began commissioning television sitcoms.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="30">
 Or the Gallup Poll ran a slate of candidates.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="29">
 &ldquo;We built the Internet standard for influence and reputation, but didn&rsquo;t have consumer utility,&rdquo; says Fernandez.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="28">
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big step for our company.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="27">
 It&rsquo;s also an internally scary transition&mdash;from being focused on the score to trying to be a utility for the world.&rdquo;
</span>

Klout Experts.
 </p>
</div>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="38">
 How does this new service, called Klout Experts, work?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="37">
 For the past few months, visitors to the Klout website, vanity-trolling for their ratings, have been notified that &ldquo;someone&rdquo; has asked them a question, and provides a space to answer in 300 characters or less.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="36">
 So far there&rsquo;s been only been a thousand or so questions, but Fernandez says that will soon increase to thousands a day.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="35">
 People are answering those questions, and in the next few months the database of answers will climb into the millions.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="34">
 Klout will soon be able to match popular questions with answers, rate them, and deliver better answer.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="33">
 It will also identify which experts are best&mdash;allowing sponsors will to target them as influencers.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="43">
 Next will come instant answers.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="42">
 Klout will ping experts when someone is asking a question they know something about.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="41">
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terrible at tools,&rdquo; says Fernandez.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="40">
 &ldquo;In about a year from now, I hope that when I&rsquo;m at Home Depot, I can pull out my phone, get an influencer in real time, and have a two-minute conversation about what to buy.&rdquo; Eventually Fernandez hopes the site becomes a thriving bazaar for questions and answers.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="39">
 Presumably, advertisers will be able to target ads to exchanges relevant to their products&mdash;just at the moment when people are interested.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="47">
 In part because of that huge advertising potential, answering questions is the passion of Internet companies big and small.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="46">
 Klout&rsquo;s new competition is broad and formidable.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="45">
 Google supplies over 30 million links to the query, &ldquo;How do I boil water?&rdquo; Quora is built on questions; for instance, ninety-nine thoughtful people have responded to a Quora question, &ldquo;Is getting rich worth it?&rdquo; (Fernandez says that Quora&rsquo;s questions are more &ldquo;existential&rdquo; than Klout&rsquo;s nuts-and-bolts-y queries.) Content assembly lines like Demand Media have knocked off millions of pithy answers to every stupid question you can imagine.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="44">
 There&rsquo;s a particularly avid passel of costly services that specialize in expert answers.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="51">
 Klout argues that its edge will be the implicit promise that providing good answers will boost your influence and thereby your score.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="50">
 There&rsquo;s a weird element of recursion in this: In addition to gauging your mojo on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and the rest, Klout will be measuring Klout clout.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="49">
 &ldquo;We think of it agnostically as compared to the other score sites,&rdquo; says Fernandez.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="48">
 &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just another network that has its own weights and issues.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="57">
 But there&rsquo;s another incentive for Klout users to answer questions: the best answers will also reach a new audience.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="56">
 Klout has a partnership with Bing that gives Microsoft&rsquo;s search engine access to answers from Klout experts.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="55">
 In fact, so far most of the questions posed to Klout users have come from Microsoft, drawn from popular Bing request.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="54">
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of our social search effort,&rdquo; says Lawrence Ripsher, a Bing executive.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="53">
 &ldquo;&rdquo;We&rsquo;ve already integrated existing content.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="52">
 The next step is creating content with searches in mind.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="61">
 This evokes answer mills like Demand Media.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="60">
 But instead of paying freelancers to churn out quick little articles for a couple of bucks each, Klout and Bing are getting people to share their expertise for free.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="59">
 &ldquo;We own the answer,&rdquo; says Fernandez.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="58">
 &lsquo;You&rsquo;re free to share it anywhere, do whatever you want with it&ndash;but we are also building a database.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="69">
 Users do get the benefit of exposure.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="68">
 That&rsquo;s what the lure is for Yolanda Vanveen, a gardening maven who lives near Portland, Oregon.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="67">
 She&rsquo;s already a deft social media user, particularly on YouTube, where she has posted over 1000 videos.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="66">
 Her Klout score is an excellent 74.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="65">
 (Welcome to the Admiral&rsquo;s Club!) Now, by answering Klout Expert questions like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the best way to care for tulips?&rdquo; she can raise it higher and provide answers to Klout users.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="64">
 Even better, Bing users may get her wisdom ranked higher than any source in the world&mdash;and there also will be a link to her Klout page.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="63">
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ecstatic about that,&rdquo; says Vanveen.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="62">
 &ldquo;I want to get my sustainable gardening message out.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="72">
 Joe Fernandez hopes that there are plenty of Yolanda Vanveens out there.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="71">
 He also hopes that the self-selected group of people who jack up their Klout score by answering questions won&rsquo;t give the impression that the entire scoring system is somewhat polluted.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="70">
 Most of all, he&rsquo;s betting that his new system will make people change their habits and seek answers from Klout Experts.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="73">
 Win or lose, Klout is now playing the game, and not just keeping score.

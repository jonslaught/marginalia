 I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="2">
 I never graduated from college.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="1">
 Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="0">
 Today I want to tell you three stories from my life.
</span>
That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="4">
 The first story is about connecting the dots.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="5">
 I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
</span>
So why did I drop out?
</p>
<p>
It started before I was born.
<span class="marker" id="11">
 My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="10">
 She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="9">
 Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="8">
 So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?"  They said: "Of course."  My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="7">
 She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="6">
 She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="19">
 And 17 years later I did go to college.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="18">
 But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="17">
 After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="16">
 I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="15">
 And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="14">
 So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="13">
 It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="12">
 The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.
</span>
</p>
<p>
It wasn't all romantic.
<span class="marker" id="21">
 I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5&cent; deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.
</span>
I loved it.
<span class="marker" id="20">
 And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
</span>
Let me give you one example:
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="26">
 Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="25">
 Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="24">
 Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="23">
 I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="22">
 It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="35">
 None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="34">
 But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="33">
 And we designed it all into the Mac.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="32">
 It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="31">
 If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="30">
 And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="29">
 If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="28">
 Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="27">
 But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="39">
 Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="38">
 So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="37">
 You have to trust in something &mdash; your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="36">
 This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="40">
 My second story is about love and loss.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="49">
 I was lucky &mdash; I found what I loved to do early in life.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="48">
 Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="47">
 We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="46">
 We had just released our finest creation &mdash; the Macintosh &mdash; a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.
</span>
And then I got fired.
<span class="marker" id="45">
 How can you get fired from a company you started?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="44">
 Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="43">
 But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="42">
 When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.
</span>
So at 30 I was out.  And very publicly out.
<span class="marker" id="41">
 What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="57">
 I really didn't know what to do for a few months.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="56">
 I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="55">
 I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="54">
 I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="53">
 But something slowly began to dawn on me &mdash; I still loved what I did.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="52">
 The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="51">
 I had been rejected, but I was still in love.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="50">
 And so I decided to start over.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="60">
 I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="59">
 The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="58">
 It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="64">
 During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="63">
 Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film,
 <em>
  Toy Story
 </em>
 , and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="62">
 In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="61">
 And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="76">
 I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="75">
 It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="74">
 Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick.
</span>
Don't lose faith.
<span class="marker" id="73">
 I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="72">
 You've got to find what you love.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="71">
 And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="70">
 Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="69">
 And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="68">
 If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.
</span>
Don't settle.
<span class="marker" id="67">
 As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="66">
 And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="65">
 So keep looking until you find it.
</span>
Don't settle.
</p>
<p>
My third story is about death.
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="77">
 When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."  It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"  And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="81">
 Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="80">
 Because almost everything &mdash; all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="79">
 Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
</span>
You are already naked.
<span class="marker" id="78">
 There is no reason not to follow your heart.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="88">
 About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="87">
 I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="86">
 I didn't even know what a pancreas was.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="85">
 The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="84">
 My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="83">
 It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="82">
 It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.
</span>
It means to say your goodbyes.
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="92">
 I lived with that diagnosis all day.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="91">
 Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="90">
 I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="89">
 I had the surgery and I'm fine now.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="94">
 This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="93">
 Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:
</span>
</p>
<p>
No one wants to die.
<span class="marker" id="100">
 Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="99">
 And yet death is the destination we all share.
</span>
No one has ever escaped it.
<span class="marker" id="98">
 And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.
</span>
It is Life's change agent.
<span class="marker" id="97">
 It clears out the old to make way for the new.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="96">
 Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="95">
 Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="105">
 Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="104">
 Don't be trapped by dogma &mdash; which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="103">
 Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="102">
 And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="101">
 They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
</span>
Everything else is secondary.
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="109">
 When I was young, there was an amazing publication called
 <em>
  The Whole Earth Catalog
 </em>
 , which was one of the bibles of my generation.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="108">
 It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="107">
 This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="106">
 It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="116">
 Stewart and his team put out several issues of
 <em>
  The Whole Earth Catalog
 </em>
 , and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="115">
 It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="114">
 On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="113">
 Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="112">
 Stay Foolish."  It was their farewell message as they signed off.
</span>
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
<span class="marker" id="111">
 And I have always wished that for myself.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="110">
 And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
</span>
</p>
<p>
Stay Hungry.  Stay Foolish.
</p>
<p>
Thank you all very much.
</p>

 Take a look at these farm houses which I saw under construction in remote areas of Yunnan province China.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="7">
 They were not unusual; farmsteads this size were everywhere in rural China.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="6">
 Note the scale of these massive buildings.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="5">
 Each support post is cut from a single huge tree.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="4">
 The massive earth walls are three stories high and taper toward the top.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="3">
 They are homes for a single extended family built in the traditional Tibetan farmhouse style.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="2">
 They are larger than most middle-class American homes.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="1">
 The extensive wood carvings inside and outside will be painted in garish colors, like this family room shown in a finished home.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="0">
 This area of Yunnan is consider one of the poorer areas in China, and the standard of living of the inhabitants here would be classified as "poor."
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="10">
 Part of the reason is that these homes have no running water, no grid electricity, and no toilets.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="9">
 They don't even have outhouses.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="11">
 But the farmers and their children who live in these homes all have cell phones, and they have accounts on the Chinese versions of Twitter and Facebook, and recharge via solar panels.

 This is important because a recent thought-provoking article by a renowned economist argues that the US economy has not been growing during the internet boom and probably will not grow any more than it has already because computers and the internet are not as productive as the last two industrial revolutions.

<span class="marker" id="13">
 Economic Growth Over?
 (PDF) by Robert Gordon.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="18">
 Gordon answers his own question with: Yes, US economic growth is over for a while.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="17">
 I think Robert Gordon is wrong about his conclusion, but I wanted to start with one of the bits of evidence he offers for his view.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="16">
 He is trying to argue that the consequences of the 2nd Industrial Revolution, which bought to common people electricity and plumbing, was far more important than the computers and internet which the 3rd Industrial Revolution has brought us.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="15">
 (Gordon's 1st Industrial revolution was steam and railroads.) As evidence of this claim he offers this hypothetical choice between option A and option B.
</span>
</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="marker" id="22">
 With option A you are allowed to  keep 2002 electronic technology, including your Windows 98 laptop accessing Amazon, and  you can keep running water and indoor toilets; but you can&rsquo;t use anything invented since 2002.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="21">
 Option B is that you get everything invented in the past decade right up to Facebook,  Twitter, and the iPad, but you have to give up running water and indoor toilets.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="20">
 You have to haul the water into your dwelling and carry out the waste.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="19">
 Even at 3am on a rainy night, your only toilet option is a wet and perhaps muddy walk to the outhouse.
</span>
Which option do you choose?
</blockquote>
<p>
Gordon then goes on to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="marker" id="23">
 I have posed this imaginary choice to several audiences in speeches, and the usual reaction is a guffaw, a chuckle, because the preference for Option A is so obvious.
</span>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="24">
 But as I just recounted, Option A is not obvious at all.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="32">
 The farmers in rural China have chosen cell phones and twitter over toilets and running water.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="31">
 To them, this is not a hypothetical choice at all, but a real one.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="30">
 and they have made their decision in massive numbers.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="29">
 Tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions, if not billions of people in the rest of Asia, Africa and South America have chosen Option B.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="28">
 You can go to almost any African village to see this.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="27">
 And it is not because they are too poor to afford a toilet.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="26">
 As you can see from these farmers' homes in Yunnan, they definitely could have at least built an outhouse if they found it valuable.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="25">
 (I know they don't have a toilet because I've stayed in many of their homes.) But instead they found the intangible benefits of connection to be greater than the physical comforts of running water.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="34">
 Most of the poor of the world don't have such access to resources as these Yunnan farmers, but even in their poorer environment they still choose to use their meager cash to purchase the benefits of the 3rd revolution over the benefits of the 2nd revolution.
</span>
Connection before plumbing.
<span class="marker" id="33">
 It is an almost universal choice.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="35">
 This choice may seem difficult for someone who has little experience in the developing world, but in the places were most of the world lives we can plainly see that the fruits of the 3rd generation of automation are at least as, and perhaps more, valuable than some fruits of the 2nd wave of industrialization.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="40">
 So if people value the benefits of computers and internet so much why don't we see this value reflected in the growth of the US economy?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="39">
 According to Gordon growth has stalled in the internet age.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="38">
 This question was first asked by Robert Solow in 1987 and Gordon's answer is that there are 6 "headwinds," six negative, or contrary forces which deduct growth from the growth due to technology in the US (Gordon reiterates he is only speaking of he US).
</span>
<span class="marker" id="37">
 The six "headwinds" slowing down growth are the aging of the US population, stagnant levels of education, rising inequality, outsourcing and globalization, environmental constraints, and household and government debt.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="36">
 I agree with Gordon about these headwinds, particularly the first one, which he also sees as the most important.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="41">
 Where Gordon is wrong is his misunderstanding and underestimating of the power of technological growth before it meets these headwinds.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="43">
 First, as mentioned above, he underestimates the value of the innovations that the internet has brought us.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="42">
 They seem trivial compared to running water and electric lights, but in fact, as billions around the world show us, they are just as valuable.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="44">
 So back to Solow; if digital innovations, millions of apps, the vast social networks that are being woven are increasing our living standards where is the evidence in the GDP?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="45">
 I think the key sentence in Gordon's paper is this:
</span>
</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="marker" id="46">
 "Both the first two revolutions required about 100 years for their full effects to percolate through the economy."
</span>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="47">
 Repeat: it took a century for the full benefits of the innovations to show up.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="54">
 By my calculation we are into year 20 of this 3rd upheaval.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="53">
 Gordon wants to start the clock on the 3rd Industrial Revolution in 1960 at the start of commercial computers.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="52">
 That's an arbitrary starting point; I would arbitrarily start it at the dawn of the commercial internet because I don't think unconnected computers by themselves are revolutionary.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="51">
 Unconnected computers did not change much.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="50">
 Standalone personal computers hardly changed our lives at all.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="49">
 They sped up typing, altered publishing, and changed spreadsheet modeling forever, but these were minor blips in the economy and well-being of most people.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="48">
 Big mainframe computers helped the largest corporations manage financial assets or logistics, but a number of studies have shown that they did not elevate much growth.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="61">
 Everything changed, however, when computers married the telephone.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="60">
 This is when ordinary people noticed computers.
</span>
They could get online. Everything went online.
<span class="marker" id="59">
 Retail changed, production changed, occupations changed.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="58">
 This communication revolution accelerated change elsewhere.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="57">
 Processes and gizmos got smarter because they were connected.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="56">
 Now the advantages of personal computers made sense because in fact they were just local terminals in something bigger: the network.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="55">
 As the Sun Computer company famously put it: the network is the computer.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="62">
 So the 3rd Industrial Revolution is not really computers and the internet, it is the networking of everything.
</span> <br>
<span class="marker" id="65">
 And in that regime we are just at the beginning of the beginning.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="64">
 We have only begun to connect everything to everything and to make little network minds everywhere.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="63">
 It may take another 80 years for the full affect of this revolution to be revealed.
</span>
 </br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="68">
 In the year 2095 when economic grad students are asked to review this paper of Robert Gordon and write about why he was wrong back in 2012, they will say things like "Gordon missed the impact from the real inventions of this revolution: big data, ubiquitous mobile, quantified self, cheap AI, and personal work robots.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="67">
 All of these were far more consequential than stand alone computation, and yet all of them were embryonic and visible when he wrote his paper.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="66">
 He was looking backwards instead of forward."
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="74">
 Finally, Gordon is focused, as most economists, on GDP which measures the amount of "labor saving" that has been accomplished.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="73">
 The more labor you save while making or serving something, the more productive you are.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="72">
 In the calculus of traditional economics productivity equals wealth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="71">
 Gordon rightly points out that so far the internet has not saved a lot of labor.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="70">
 As I argue in my robot piece in Wired,
 <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/12/ff-robots-will-take-our-jobs/all/">
  Better Than Human
 </a>
 (not my title), I think the real wealth in the future does not come from saving labor but in creating new kinds of things to do.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="69">
 In this sense long-term wealth depends on making new labor.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="84">
 Civilization is not just about saving labor but also about "wasting" labor to make art, to make beautiful things, to "waste" time playing, like sports.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="83">
 Nobody ever suggested that Picasso should spend fewer hours painting per picture in order to boost his wealth or improve the economy.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="82">
 The value he added to the economy could not be optimized for productivity.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="81">
 It's hard to shoehorn some of the most important things we do in life into the category of "being productive." Generally any task that can be measured by the metrics of productivity -- output per hour -- is a task we want automation to do.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="80">
 In short, productivity is for robots.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="79">
 Humans excel at wasting time, experimenting, playing, creating, and exploring.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="78">
 None of these fare well under the scrutiny of productivity.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="77">
 That is why science and art are so hard to fund.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="76">
 But they are also the foundation of long-term growth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="75">
 Yet our notions of jobs, of work, of the economy don't include a lot of space for wasting time, experimenting, playing, creating, and exploring.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="91">
 Long-term growth of that type that Robert Gordon studies is really weird if you think about it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="90">
 As he notes, there wasn't much of it in the world before 1750, before technological progress.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="89">
 Now several centuries later we have a thousand times as much wealth as before.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="88">
 Where does this extra good stuff come from?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="87">
 It is not moved from somewhere else, or borrowed.
</span>
It is self-created.
<span class="marker" id="86">
 There's a system which manufactures this wealth "out of nothing."  Much like life itself.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="85">
 There are certainly necessary conditions and ingredients, but it seems once you have those in place, the economy (the system) will self-generate this wealth.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="95">
 A number of economists have wrestled with the origins of this self-generating wealth.

  Brian Arthur
 </a>
 both separately point to the recombining and re-mixing of existing ideas as the way economic growth occurs.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="93">
 This view focuses on knowledge as the prime motor in a self-renewing circle of increasing returns.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="92">
 Unlike say energy or matter, the more knowledge you spend, the more knowledge you earn, and the more breeds more in a never-ending virtuous spiral.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="102">
 What is important is that this self-increasing cycle makes things that are new.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="101">
 New goods, new services, new dreams, new ambitions, even new needs.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="100">
 When things are new they are often not easy to measure, not easy to detect, nor easy to optimize.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="99">
 The 1st Industrial Revolution that introduced steam and railways also introduced new ideas about ownership, identity, privacy, and literacy.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="98">
 These ideas were not "productive" at first, but over time as they seeped into law, and culture, and became embedded into other existing technologies, they helped work to become more productive.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="97">
 For example ideas of ownership and capital became refined and unleashed new arrangements for funding large-scale projects in more efficient ways.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="96">
 In some cases these indirect ideas may have more long-term affect on growth than the immediate inventions of the time.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="103">
 Likewise the grand shift our society is undergoing now, moving to a highly networked world in the third phase of industrialization, is producing many innovations that 1) are hard to perceive, 2) not really about optimizing labor, and 3) therefore hard to quantify in terms of productivity.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="104">
 One has the sense that if we wait a while, the new things will trickled down and find places in the machinery of commerce where they can eventually boost the efficiency of work.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="107">
 But it seems to me that there is second-order tilt in this shift to a networked world that says the real wealth in the long-term, or perhaps that should be the new wealth, will not be found merely in greater productivity, but in greater degrees of playing, creating, and exploring.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="106">
 We don't have good metrics for new possibilities, for things that have never been seen before, because by definition, their boundaries, distinctions, and units are unknown.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="105">
 How does one measure "authenticity" or "hyperreality" or "stickiness"?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="110">
 Productivity is the main accomplishment, and metric, of the two previous Industrial Revolutions.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="109">
 Productivity won't go away; over the long term it will take fewer hours of human work to produce more of the goods and services those economies produce.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="108">
 Our system will do this primarily because most of this work will be done by bots.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="115">
 The main accomplishment of this 3rd Industrialization, the networking of our brains, other brains and other things, is to add something onto the substrate of productivity.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="114">
 Call it consumptity, or
 <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2010/04/two_kinds_of_ge.php">
  generativity
 </a>
 .
</span>
<span class="marker" id="113">
 By whatever name we settle on, this frontier expands the creative aspect of the whole system, increasing innovations, expanding possibilities, encouraging the inefficiencies of experiment and exploring, absorbing more of the qualities of play.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="112">
 We don't have good measurements of these yet.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="111">
 Cynics will regard this as new age naivet&eacute;, or unadorned utopianism, or a blindness to the "realities" of real life of greedy corporations, or bad bosses, or the inevitable suffering of real work.
</span>
It's not.
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="118">
 The are two senses of growth: scale, that is, more, bigger, faster; and evolution.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="117">
 The linear progression of steam power, railways, electrification, and now computers and the internet is a type of the former; just more of the same, but only better.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="116">
 Therefore the productivity growth curve should continue up in a continuous linear fashion.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="121">
 I suggest the growth of this 3rd regime is more like evolutionary growth, rather than developmental growth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="120">
 The apparent stagnation we see in productivity, in real wages, in debt relief, is because we don't reckon, and don't perceive, the new directions of growth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="119">
 It is not more of the same, but different.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="125">
 Say we are watching an organism evolve.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="124">
 It might over time become extremely efficient in its energy use.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="123">
 Or it might become very large, cleverly optimizing its metabolic rate to manage its new girth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="122">
 In either case, if we were biological economists watching it we would declare the organism to have grown in productivity.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="130">
 But we can also imagine many other ways this organism might grow or evolve while keeping its metabolism steady.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="129">
 It could start complexifying, becoming multicellular.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="128">
 It might develop new sensors increasing its range of interaction.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="127">
 It might sift its reproductive strategy from making only one offspring garnering much attention, to making thousands of them with less care.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="126">
 It might evolve a tail and change its mode of locomotion entirely -- all the time leaving its metabolism rate unaltered.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="132">
 Our economy is moving into the latter mode of growth -- an evolutionary uplift, which may or may not show an increase in productivity, particularly at the start of this phase.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="131">
 We see hints of this evolutionary growth already.
</span>
The US economy shows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="marker" id="133">
 Increased complexity  -- Derivatives, derivatives of the derivatives, flash crowds, dark pools of money, there are hundreds of new instruments and states of money.
</span>
 <p>
<span class="marker" id="134">
 Increased interdependency  -- National economies, particularly the US, are not longer independent cells, but part of a multi-organel system.
</span>
 </p>
 <p>
<span class="marker" id="135">
 Increasing ubiquity of finance and monetization -- More of our lives, from games to socializing to cooking to child caring, are now part of the greater economy.
</span>
 </p>
 <p>
<span class="marker" id="136">
 Decreasing emphasis on ownership -- In the parts of the economy run on information, data, and knowledge, these key ingredients can be used without owning them, and in fact often are more valuable when not "owned."
</span>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="137">
 There are many more, but these few demonstrate the way the economy is shifting rather than simply accelerating (although it is doing that too).
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="143">
 Technology will continue to increase productivity for the commodities of life, even if it takes another 80 years.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="142">
 But the next phase we are rushing into -- the 3rd Industrial Revolution, the world of networks -- the non-commodities of life will play a greater role in economic terms.

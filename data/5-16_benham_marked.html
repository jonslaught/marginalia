 Our baby came swirling into view in black and white, week after week, in the grainy wedge on the ultrasound monitor.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="1">
 First a dark featureless pool, then a tiny orb, then budding arms and legs and finally long fingers and a recognizable profile.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="0">
 Precisely on schedule, I felt her squirm and thump.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="3">
 After years of grueling and unnatural fertility treatments, the promise of her unfolded easily.

 We learned her gender in week 16, cataloged her anatomy in week 20.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="7">
 I scrubbed the baseboards in the spare bedroom and stopped buttoning my jeans.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="6">
 I tried to imagine her as a real child, in my hands and in my life.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="5">
 I drew, in ballpoint pen, her cartoon outline on my skin &mdash; with big eyes, a sprout of hair, and an umbilical tether to my navel that made her look like a startled space walker.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="4">
 That was the extent to which I understood her: only in outline, the details waiting to be filled in.
</span>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly there was blood. Blood on my hands.
<span class="marker" id="12">
 Blood on a thin cotton hospital gown.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="11">
 Blood in red rivulets and blood in dark clumps.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="10">
 Bright beads of blood on the doctor&rsquo;s blue latex gloves.

 Blood in such startling quantity we could only imagine there was no life, no baby, not anymore.

 My obstetrician looked stricken that day in March 2011 when he rushed into a triage room at Bayfront Medical Center.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="16">
 I clenched and vomited as he explained that our baby had no chance of surviving outside the womb &mdash; if she wasn&rsquo;t already gone.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="15">
 A tech tried for long minutes to summon a heartbeat on the monitor, searching every quadrant of my abdomen.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="14">
 I don&rsquo;t remember if we held our breath or gasped or spoke or sobbed.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="13">
 I remember only the frozen shock when a heartbeat flooded the room, a sound like a galloping horse.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="23">
 In just a few hours, our baby had been lost and then found.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="22">
 On the monitor, she bobbed and floated in a pixelated haze.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="21">
 But next to her loomed a mysterious shape that had not been there two days before: a clot of blood the size of a fist, created as the placenta had begun to tear loose from my body.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="20">
 A nurse pumped drugs into an IV to stall the labor, and gradually they took a tenuous hold.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="19">
 But it was clear to everyone that the reprieve was temporary.

 Early arrival kills more newborns than anything else, and complications from prematurity kill more babies in the first year than anything else.

<span class="marker" id="30">
 Some babies are born so early they are beyond rescue.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="29">
 If a baby is born at or before the 22nd week, it is usually considered a miscarriage or a stillbirth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="28">
 Almost no doctor will intervene, because there is nothing he or she can do.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="33">
 Other babies ripen in the womb into the third trimester but arrive a little early.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="32">
 If a baby is born later than about 25 weeks, studies show that almost all doctors feel morally and legally obligated to try to save its life.

 In between those scenarios is a zone between life and death, between viability and futility.

 New technologies can sometimes keep these micropreemies alive, but many end up disabled, some catastrophically so.

 Whether to provide care to these infants is one of the fundamental controversies in neonatology.

 Babies born at the edge of viability force us to debate the most difficult questions in medicine and in life.

 One of them was born on April 12, 2011, at Bayfront Medical Center.
</span>
My daughter.

<p>
<span class="marker" id="47">
 This summer I returned, not as a parent, but as a journalist, to the hospital where my daughter was born.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="46">
 I interviewed the people who took care of her about the scientific and ethical challenges of trying to save babies born so soon.
</span>

 I pored over her medical chart and read dozens of journal articles on extreme prematurity.
</span>

 When the doctors stalled my labor, they gave us a slim measure of hope, but no assurances.
</span>

 Our baby could die quickly, could die slowly, could suffer needlessly, could live vegetatively.

<span class="marker" id="48">
 She could be broken in any pocket of her body or mind.

<p>
<span class="marker" id="54">
 She would come squawking into the world unfinished and vulnerable.

<span class="marker" id="53">
 Conceived artificially, she would have to grow in an artificial womb.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="52">
 She would reveal to us the wonders of medicine and science, and the limits of those things.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="51">
 She would show us the ferocity of our most primal instincts.
</span>

<p>

 The Baby Place at Bayfront Medical Center is designed for celebrations.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="59">
 The rooms are private, with sleeping couches and flat screen TVs.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="58">
 Sliding panels obscure all evidence of the mess and peril of birth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="57">
 Mothers are wheeled out holding fat drowsy newborns, dutiful dads follow with the balloons.

 Every time a baby is born, the loudspeaker carries the tinkling of a lullaby.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="66">
 It&rsquo;s easy to pretend, in that cozy place, that all babies come wailing into the world pink and robust, and are bundled and hatted and handed to teary mothers and proud dads.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="65">
 But sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t go that way at all.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="64">
 That&rsquo;s why behind the sliding panels there are devices for oxygen, suction and epinephrine.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="63">
 That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a morgue on the ground floor.

<span class="marker" id="62">
 That&rsquo;s why Bayfront&rsquo;s labor and delivery unit is actually housed across the street, inside All Children&rsquo;s Hospital.

 When a baby is born in trouble, as mine was bound to be, it is already in the place that cares for some of the sickest and most fragile children in the state.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="69">
 After the day I almost lost the baby, the doctors made it clear that for now I had one purpose in life: Stay pregnant.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="68">
 In their calmest and firmest bedside voices the doctors said I had to make it another month to 24 weeks, loosely considered the limit of human viability outside the womb.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="67">
 Deliver earlier than that, and I would watch my baby struggle and die.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="74">
 I lay still in bed and watched the calendar as my baby survived to 21 weeks, then 22.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="73">
 I checked in and out of the hospital twice, and then back in.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="72">
 I Googled images of half-formed babies.
</span>
I bled and cramped.
<span class="marker" id="71">
 One tactless doctor made the situation plain when he tried to discharge me.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="70">
 &ldquo;Your baby is not viable,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so you might as well deliver at home.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="79">
 By the 23rd week, I was taunted by that incessant lullaby on the hospital loudspeaker, a reminder of how natural this process was supposed to be.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="78">
 Nothing about it had been natural for me.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="77">
 To get this far had taken four years, $40,000, four in-vitro procedures, an egg donor, lawyers, counselors and contracts.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="76">
 Now my body was trying to spit out the baby we&rsquo;d made.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="75">
 It felt like biological mutiny.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="82">
 I stayed anchored to the hospital bed by a strap around my belly that charted the volcanic activity within on a computer monitor.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="81">
 The contractions came and went, and when they got bad enough, the doctors stalled the labor by elevating my feet above my head and flooding me with magnesium sulfate, which made me feel like my blood and skin were on fire.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="80">
 That&rsquo;s how I was &mdash; inverted, scalding &mdash; when doctors conceded the baby was coming soon, and a neonatologist visited to advise my husband and me of what lay ahead.

 Aaron Germain was thin and kind, with a look of constant worry.

 I viewed him as an ambassador from the Land of Sick Babies, a place I could not imagine.

 He told us he knew how badly we wanted our child, and an army of specialists with the most advanced technology was ready upstairs to try to save her life.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="86">
 But we needed to decide whether saving her was what we really wanted.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="85">
 The effort would require months of aggressive intervention, and could leave us with a child who was alive, but very damaged.

</p>

 Every part of her was underdeveloped, fragile and weak.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="92">
 Every treatment would exact a toll.

<span class="marker" id="91">
 She might live, but she would likely have, to use the medical term, profound morbidities.

 Odds she would die, no matter how hard they tried: better than half.

 Odds she would die or be profoundly disabled: 68 percent.

 Odds she would die or be at least moderately disabled: 80 percent.

<p>
<span class="marker" id="99">
 There was a 20 percent chance she could live and be reasonably okay.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="98">
 I pictured her in the slow class at school, battling asthma or peering through thick glasses.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="97">
 We would buy her pink sparkly ones and tell her they were cool.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="104">
 I contemplated that figure: 20 percent.
</span>
It didn&rsquo;t seem hopeless.
<span class="marker" id="103">
 Then again, imagine a revolver with five chambers.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="102">
 Now put four bullets in it and play Russian roulette.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="101">
 Would we bet on a 20 percent chance if losing might mean losing everything we cared about?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="100">
 Would we torture our baby with aggressive treatment just so she could live out her life in a nursing home or on a ventilator?
</span>
Would we lose our house? Would our marriage fall apart?

Dr.
<span class="marker" id="108">
 Germain gamely counseled us as we searched for loopholes in the statistics.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="107">
 Girls do better than boys, he said, but white babies like ours fare worse than black babies.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="106">
 Our daughter would be delivered by C-section so her body didn&rsquo;t get mangled in the birth canal, and I would be injected with steroids before she was born to strengthen her lungs.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="105">
 But the figures the doctor had given us already accounted for those advantages.
</span>
</p>
<p>

 But what were the odds, we wanted to know, for a middle-class girl baby with good parents, who sing songs and read stories?

 With two big brothers and aunts and uncles and a friendly, big-eared dog?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="109">
 The baby who slumbered inside me, her heartbeat galloping along over the speakers, reminding us that she was perfectly fine in there, and safe, and how wrong it was that soon she would be wrenched into the bright, cold air, and made to breathe?
</span>
</p>
<p>
Dr.
<span class="marker" id="113">
 Germain spoke softly and didn&rsquo;t rush.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="112">
 I wanted to shake him and his probabilities, to make him yelp and tell us what to do.
</span>
</p>
<p>
He just couldn&rsquo;t say.
<span class="marker" id="114">
 The answers we wanted weren&rsquo;t in the data.
</span>
</p>
<p>

 &ldquo;The statistics don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until they happen to you.&rdquo;

 What echoed in my head was something Dr.

<span class="marker" id="116">
 Germain never said: Saving her might be the most selfish act in the world.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="127">
 After the doctor left, my husband sat on the edge of the bed and held my hand as we tried to work our way toward a decision.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="126">
 I started with shedding my expectations.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="125">
 We were a family of high achievers.

 My husband, Tom French, was a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer.

 His two sons, Nat and Sam, were salutatorian and valedictorian, respectively, at Gibbs High.

Now they were off at college.
<span class="marker" id="122">
 We had envisioned a similar path for our daughter &mdash; horseback riding, piano lessons and the dean&rsquo;s list.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="121">
 All that was gone now, and we grappled with the fundamentals.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="120">
 Would we try to keep her alive?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="119">
 If she lived, would she walk or talk?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="118">
 Would she one day give us a look that said,
 <i>
  Why did you put me through this

 ?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="134">
 People always ask me if I prayed.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="133">
 I prayed the way people in foxholes are said to pray.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="132">
 I prayed with every thought and every breath.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="131">
 And I prayed with the certainty that I had no business praying, that I hadn&rsquo;t earned the right.
</span>
I&rsquo;d never been religious.
<span class="marker" id="130">
 Worse, I knew we had defied the natural order in our determination to have a child.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="129">
 Through so many in-vitro procedures, with so many tests and needles and vials of drugs, we&rsquo;d created life in a petri dish.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="128">
 To be given a child just long enough to watch her die felt like punishment for our hubris.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="135">
 I was crying when I asked Tom, &ldquo;Did we want her too much?&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="139">
 I don&rsquo;t remember sleeping that night.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="138">
 As dawn crept closer, we both swallowed the thing we couldn&rsquo;t say.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="137">
 I knew once I said it our baby would be gone, and we&rsquo;d be the parents who&rsquo;d turned our backs.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="136">
 Tom climbed in next to me on the skinny bed and wrapped his arms around me and all of the wires as best he could.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="140">
 &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to do this,&rdquo; he said.
</span>
</p>
<p>
Our baby&rsquo;s heart kept beating.

 I held out my iPhone and used its voice recorder to capture the sound, in case it was the only evidence of my daughter I would ever have.

Google was of no use.

 The research was confusing and out of date.

 Nurse practitioner Diane Loisel found us still choking on indecision and grief.

<span class="marker" id="148">
 She was so straightforward and so patient, it was clear that her only priority was our baby.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="154">
 Diane told us she had worked with small and sick babies for 30 years.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="153">
 When she started, 23 weekers never made it out of the delivery room.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="152">
 Any baby born weighing less than 1,000 grams &mdash; about 2 pounds &mdash; was considered not viable and allowed to die.

 But now science had advanced, raising new questions for everybody.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="158">
 Some parents insisted the doctors do everything possible, and then insisted on the impossible too.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="157">
 Diane told us it sometimes made her angry to see tiny babies subjected to futile intervention, to see them go into nursing homes or to families ill equipped to care for them.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="156">
 The more educated parents asked more questions, considered quality of life.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="155">
 Diane often wondered if asking parents to make such life-and-death decisions was cruel.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="159">
 When it came to babies born at 23 weeks, research showed, there was little consensus from one hospital to the next or even among doctors working the same shift in the same unit.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="162">
 Some were born limp and blue, and some came out pink and crying.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="161">
 In those first hours and days, much could be revealed.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="160">
 And there was a window of time, while the baby was on a ventilator and still very fragile, when doctors and families could reverse course and withdraw life support.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="163">
 &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to decide right now,&rdquo; she said.
</span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a process.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="167">
 She seemed to be offering an escape from the torment we had suffered all night.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="166">
 Enough of the unbearable coin toss.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="165">
 We could let them intervene and see how it went.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="164">
 If our baby was born too weak, we could decide later to let her go.

</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="169">
 &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want her to suffer,&rdquo; Tom said.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="168">
 &ldquo;But we want our baby to have a chance.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="172">
 As Diane headed back to the NICU, she told me later, she knew she had changed everything.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="171">
 She also knew that once a mother had seen her baby for the first time, there often was no turning back.

 She hoped we wouldn&rsquo;t blame her for the rest of our lives.

 I imagined my baby gathering a few more air sacs in her budding lungs, a few more ripples in her developing brain.

 Every hour was crucial, but how many would be enough?

 Tom and I discovered it was impossible to stay miserable around the clock.

 We amused ourselves by speculating about the romantic lives of the doctors and nurses.

 One doctor looked like a lost Kennedy.

 Another one &mdash; I called him Dimples &mdash; kept the nurses laughing.

<span class="marker" id="176">
 I imagined all of them screwing in supply closets and gossiping at the nurses&rsquo; station.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="175">
 One of the doctors, while sketching a diagram of the untenable situation in my uterus, asked if I had any questions.
</span>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Just one,&rdquo; I said.
<span class="marker" id="183">
 &ldquo;Is it me or are the people on this floor unusually hot?&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="184">
 &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and thank God for it.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="186">
 All of these people had been between my legs, and I was too wrecked to care.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="185">
 The absurdity of it made me laugh, even though laughter was discouraged while on bed rest.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="188">
 That afternoon we watched DVDs and allowed ourselves to hope the doctors were wrong and we would make it another week.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="187">
 As soon as the sky darkened outside the window, I tried to sleep, to make the day end before anything could ruin it.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="193">
 Still tethered like Gulliver by IVs and wires, I shifted left, then back to the right.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="192">
 Adjusted the bed up and back down.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="191">
 Stole my husband&rsquo;s pillow and asked the nurse for extra blankets.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="190">
 A vague sense of unease settled in and I shut my eyes and willed it away.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="189">
 The monitor registered no unusual activity.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="194">
 When the nurse came in for yet another blood pressure, I told her I felt strange.
</span>
</p>
<p>
Constipation, she said.
</p>
<p>
At first it was uncomfortable. Then it started to hurt.
<span class="marker" id="197">
 The monitor mocked me with its refusal to acknowledge what I was feeling.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="196">
 I kept moving the straps around, trying to pick up the signal, then gave up and tossed them all off.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="195">
 I paced the floor, clutching an IV pole, setting off alarms at the nurse&rsquo;s desk.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="201">
 I had a prescription for morphine, but the nurse stuck to her constipation theory and refused to give me any pain relief at all.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="200">
 I cramped for hours until she sent my husband on a 2 a.m.
</span>
trek through St.
<span class="marker" id="199">
 Petersburg in search of prune juice.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="198">
 By the time Tom returned with a 64-ounce bottle, I was screaming on the bathroom floor.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="202">
 The pain was sharp and low and I could feel the baby kicking with both feet like a mule trying to take down a barn door.
</span>
&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; I told the baby. &ldquo;Be still.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="205">
 The nurse appeared in the doorway.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="204">
 &ldquo;What would it feel like if there were feet coming out of me?&rdquo; I asked her.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="203">
 &ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s what this feels like.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, honey,&rdquo; she assured me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="208">
 A doctor finally checked just before dawn.
</span>
I was sobbing and gulping air.
<span class="marker" id="207">
 I asked him if he could put me in a coma, and make it all stop, and wake me up in a couple of months when the baby was bigger.
</span>
Or maybe he could sew me shut. Or hang me upside down.
<span class="marker" id="206">
 He pulled on his gloves and told me to be still and to breathe.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="209">
 &ldquo;Please be careful please be careful please be careful.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t get my breath.
</span>
&ldquo;Please be careful.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="210">
 He reached in and felt the baby&rsquo;s feet, just where I knew he would find them.
</span>
</p>
<p>
A second doctor confirmed it. &ldquo;We have to go now,&rdquo; she said.
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="211">
 We&rsquo;d made it 23 weeks and six days.
</span>
</p>
<p>
&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="213">
 I watched the ceiling roll by as nurses whisked me on my hospital bed to Operating Room 4.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="212">
 Doctors debated whether there was time for anesthesia, then someone rolled me over and put a needle in my spine and the pain washed away.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="214">
 If I&rsquo;d been able to sit up and look around, I would have seen a group from the NICU, called the Stork Team, preparing to stabilize the baby in a room next to the O.R.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="218">
 Gwen Newton was the Stork Team nurse that day.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="217">
 She described it all for me later.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="216">
 She said most mornings, she needs a good jolt of coffee to get going.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="215">
 But today, all it took was a look at her assignment sheet:
 <i>
  23 weeker.
 </i>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="219">
 When she was pregnant with her son, she said, she had nightmares that he was born at 23 weeks.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="221">
 She readied a mobile incubator that would keep the baby warm and monitored on the short ride to the NICU.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="220">
 She made a nest of blankets and spread a pillowcase over it to catch the blood.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="226">
 The baby&rsquo;s arm would be so small she&rsquo;d use a rubber band for a tourniquet.
</span>
She got out a No.
<span class="marker" id="225">
 1 blood pressure cuff, small enough to fit around her finger.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="224">
 She set the warmer to 37 degrees Celsius, laid out catheters for IVs and wires for monitors.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="223">
 She drew a mixture of sugar and dextrose in a 60 mL syringe &mdash; a snack to get the baby started.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="222">
 And she drew 1.4 mL of an artificial lung surfactant &mdash; a milky mix of fats and proteins that would help prevent the baby&rsquo;s sticky lungs from collapsing.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="228">
 A respiratory technician was prepping the ventilator and a neonatologist and a nurse practitioner were studying the chart.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="227">
 When Gwen had everything ready, she stepped to the doorway to watch the C-section.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="231">
 Some of what happened next would be out of her control.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="230">
 Some babies came out fighting and some did not.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="229">
 <i>
  You never know what&rsquo;s coming out of that belly
 </i>
 , she thought.
</span>
</p>
<p>
&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
</p>
<p>
I felt a sickening tug.
<span class="marker" id="232">
 I knew that we were two separate people now.
</span>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s kicking,&rdquo; Tom said.
<span class="marker" id="235">
 He was peering over the surgical drape at the gaping red meat of my abdomen, and at the creature that had just emerged from it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="234">
 Someone said she cried, but I didn&rsquo;t hear it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="233">
 I tasted prune vomit in my mouth.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="238">
 Pretty soon someone slipped a piece of paper in front of me, and an ink pad, and asked for a fingerprint.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="237">
 On the paper were two still-wet footprints, each an inch and a half long.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="236">
 Startling evidence that she was here.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="239">
 &ldquo;My baby,&rdquo; I kept saying, &ldquo;my baby, my baby.&rdquo;
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="245">
 Gwen took the tiny blood-spotted bundle from the delivery nurse.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="244">
 She unwrapped her, laid her on heat packs, and slipped her into a plastic bag up to her neck to help prevent heat and fluid loss.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="243">
 Gwen rubbed and dried her like a mother cat roughs up a kitten, but more gently, so as not to tear her skin.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="242">
 The baby was dusky blue, then dark red.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="241">
 Gwen pinched the tiny greenish umbilical cord between her thumb and forefinger and felt it throb.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="240">
 She counted 17 beats in six seconds.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="246">
 &ldquo;Heart rate is 170,&rdquo; she called out.
</span>
It was strong, a good sign.
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="252">
 The baby was trying to breathe but her lungs were not ready and her muscles were weak.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="251">
 Through the stethoscope her breathing sounded squeaky and coarse.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="250">
 A respiratory technician threaded a tube the size of thick spaghetti through her mouth and into her chest.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="249">
 Into the tube she placed the milky fluid that would coat the baby&rsquo;s lungs.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="248">
 She connected her to a small portable ventilator that delivered oxygen at a constant pressure, and tapped her finger over a hole in the tube to pace the breaths.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="247">
 The baby&rsquo;s chest heaved mechanically.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="254">
 She weighed 570 grams &mdash; 1 pound, 4 ounces.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="253">
 She was 11.4 inches long &mdash; the length of a Barbie doll.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="257">
 I saw Gwen roll the incubator past.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="256">
 Inside was a raw dark creature, a blur in a too-big hat.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="255">
 My husband looked at me and looked at the baby.
</span>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Go with her,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Please go.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="266">
 A baby at 23 weeks&rsquo; gestation has just begun to hear, but can&rsquo;t yet see.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="265">
 It may recognize its mother&rsquo;s voice.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="264">
 It has a dawning awareness of whether it is right side up or upside down.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="263">
 The surface of its brain is smooth, just beginning to develop the hills and valleys that become wrinkles and folds.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="262">
 It responds to pain, but has no capacity for memory or for complex thought.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="261">
 Its lungs look like scrawny saplings compared to the full, bushy trees of normal lungs.
</span>
Its bones are soft. It swallows.
<span class="marker" id="260">
 Its hair and eyelashes are just starting to grow and its fingernails and fingerprints are just forming.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="259">
 Its body is covered with a soft protective down.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="258">
 It is recognizably human, but barely.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="267">
 I was still in recovery when Tom returned from the NICU, crying.
</span>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so perfect,&rdquo; he said. His voice was a squeak. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
I just stared at him.
<span class="marker" id="269">
 My sweet, emotional husband, in the grip of something terrifying and overwhelming.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="268">
 He&rsquo;d been to a place I couldn&rsquo;t fathom.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="270">
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my baby girl up there,&rdquo; he kept saying.
</span>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my daughter.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="275">
 I used to imagine what I would say to her when I first saw her.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="274">
 She&rsquo;d be wrapped in a blanket and wearing a hat, and she&rsquo;d feel solid in my arms, like a puppy.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="273">
 She might open one eye and peek up at me, perplexed but curious.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="272">
 She would know my voice and my smell, know I was her mother, and because she knew that, she would not be afraid.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="271">
 I&rsquo;d be hit with a force that would unmake me and remake me, right there.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="277">
 Instead I waited in recovery while she fought for her life somewhere beyond my reach.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="276">
 After seven hours Tom took me up to the NICU in a wheelchair, still in my cotton surgical gown, lugging an IV pole.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="279">
 Tom pushed my wheelchair up to the deep sink so I could scrub my hands.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="278">
 There were posted instructions and a disposable scrub brush and I felt determined to do it properly, for the full 30 seconds, in the hottest possible water, as if precise compliance with the rules might tip the odds.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="283">
 I saw her plastic box halfway across the room.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="282">
 I didn&rsquo;t see anything else, just this tunnel of space and time and of everything changing that marked the distance between us.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="281">
 Here I was one person and there I would become someone else.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="280">
 The soap was hard to rinse, and I let the water run for a long time.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="294">
 Tom wheeled me to her portholed plastic box.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="293">
 The nurse introduced herself as Gwen, but I barely heard her.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="292">
 There, through the clear plastic, was my daughter.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="291">
 She was red and angular, angry like a fresh wound.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="290">
 She had a black eye and bruises on her body.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="289">
 Tubes snaked out of her mouth, her belly button, her hand.
</span>
Wires moored her to monitors. Tape obscured her face.
<span class="marker" id="288">
 Her chin was long and narrow, her mouth agape because of the tubes.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="287">
 Dried blood crusted the corner of her mouth and the top of her diaper.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="286">
 The diaper was smaller than a playing card, and it swallowed her.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="285">
 She had no body fat, so she resembled a shrunken old man, missing his teeth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="284">
 Her skin was nearly translucent, and through her chest I could see her flickering heart.
</span>
</p>
<p>
She kicked and jerked.
<span class="marker" id="295">
 She stretched her arms wide, palms open, as if in welcome or surrender.
</span>
</p>
<p>
I recognized her.
<span class="marker" id="298">
 I knew the shape of her head and the curve of her butt.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="297">
 I knew the strength of her kick.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="296">
 I knew how she had fit inside me, and felt an acute sensation that she had been cut out, and of how wrong that was.
</span>
</p>
<p>
I had crazy thoughts.
<span class="marker" id="304">
 Should we prepare a birth announcement?
</span>
What would we name her?
<span class="marker" id="303">
 If she died, would we get a birth certificate?
</span>
Would there be a funeral?
<span class="marker" id="302">
 Would we get a box of ashes, and if so, what size box?
</span>
Was she aware of us?
<span class="marker" id="301">
 Did she recognize me like I recognized her?
</span>
Was she afraid?
<span class="marker" id="300">
 Did she wonder where I had gone?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="299">
 If she ever got out of this box, would she know I was her mother?
</span>
</p>
<p>
She was alien and familiar.
<span class="marker" id="308">
 She was terrifying and beautiful.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="307">
 She was complete and interrupted.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="306">
 I felt the icy hush that comes with looking at a secret you are not meant to see.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="305">
 I was peeking into God&rsquo;s pocket.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="309">
 &ldquo;You can touch her,&rdquo; Gwen said.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="313">
 I reached in through the porthole.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="312">
 I saw how white and swollen my hand was.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="311">
 I let it hover over her for a second, then pulled away, as if from a fire.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="310">
 Finally I placed the tip of my pinky into her tiny palm.
</span>
</p>
<p>
She grabbed on.
</p>

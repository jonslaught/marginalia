<span class="marker" id="12">
 Our ongoing time travel (at a velocity of one second per second) never seems to take us to a foreign place.

 Of course, a quick look back to your own life ten or twenty years back will turn up all sorts of evidence that your life has, in fact, been radically transformed, both at a micro-level and the macro-level.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="18">
 At the micro-level, I now possess a cellphone that works better than Captain Kirk&rsquo;s communicator, but I don&rsquo;t feel like I am living in the future I imagined back then, even a tiny bit.

 For a macro example, back in the eighties, people used to paint scary pictures of the world with a few billion more people and water wars.

 I think I wrote essays in school about such things.

<span class="marker" id="22">
 A slight generalization of

 What is interesting is how this psychological pre-disposition to believe in an unchanging, normal present doesn&rsquo;t kill us.

 How, as a species, are we able to prepare for, create, and deal with, the future, while managing to effectively deny that it is happening at all?

 Futurists, artists and edge-culturists like to take credit for this.

 It is just frozen in a different part of the time theater, populated by people who seek more stimulation than the mainstream, and draw on imagined futures to feed their cravings rather than inform actual future-manufacturing.

 The two beaten-to-death ways of understanding this phenomenon are due to McLuhan (&ldquo;We look at the present through a rear-view mirror.

 Both framing perspectives have serious limitations that I will get to.

</span>

 For the rest of this post, I&rsquo;ll refer to this as the Field for short.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="36">
 So we can divide the future into two useful pieces: things coming at us that have been integrated into the Field, and things that have not.

 The integration kicks in at some level of ubiquity.

Gibson got that part right.

 Let&rsquo;s call the crossing of the Field threshold by a piece of futuristic technology
 <em>
  normalization
 </em>
 (not to be confused with the postmodernist sense of the term, but related to the mathematical sense).
</span>
<span class="marker" id="37">
 Normalization involves incorporation of a piece of technological novelty into larger conceptual metaphors built out of familiar experiences.

 A simple example is commercial air travel.

<strong>
 The Example of Air Travel
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="42">
 A great deal of effort goes into making sure passengers never realize just how unnatural their state of motion is, on a commercial airplane.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="41">
 Climb rates, bank angles and acceleration profiles are maintained within strict limits.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="40">
 Back in the day, I used to do homework problems to calculate these limits.

 The travel in a manufactured normalcy field.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="43">
 Space travel is not yet common enough, so there is no manufactured normalcy field for it.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="46">
 When you are sitting on a typical modern jetliner, you are traveling at 500 mph in an aluminum tube that is actually capable of some pretty scary acrobatics.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="45">
 Including generating
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_gravity_aircraft">
  brief periods of zero-g
 </a>
 .
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="47">
 Yet a typical air traveler never experiences anything that one of our ancestors could not experience on a fast chariot or a boat.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="49">
 Air travel is manufactured normalcy.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="48">
 If you ever
 <em>
  truly
 </em>
 experience what modern air travel can do, chances are, the experience will be framed as either a bit of entertainment (&ldquo;fighter pilot for a day!&rdquo; which you will understand as &ldquo;expensive roller-coaster&rdquo;) or a visit to an alien-specialist land (American aerospace engineering students who participate in NASA summer camps often get to ride on the &ldquo;vomit comet,&rdquo; modified Boeing 727s that fly the zero-g training missions).
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="51">
 This means that even though air travel is now a hundred years old, it hasn&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;arrived&rdquo; psychologically.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="50">
 A full appreciation of what air travel is has been kept from the general population through manufactured normalcy.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="52">
 All we&rsquo;re left with is out-of-context data that we are not equipped to really understand in any deep way (&ldquo;Oh, it used to take months to sail from India to the US in the seventeenth century, and now it takes a 17 hour flight, how
 <em>
  interesting.&rdquo;
 </em>
 )
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="54">
 Think about the small fraction of humanity who have actually experienced air travel
 <em>
  qua
 </em>
 air travel, as a mode of transport distinct from older ones.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="53">
 These include fighter pilots, astronauts and the few air travelers who have been part of a serious emergency that forced (for instance) an airliner to lose 10,000 feet of altitude in a few seconds.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="56">
 Of course, manufactured normalcy is never quite perfect (passengers on the Concorde could see the earth&rsquo;s curvature for instance), but the point is, it is
 <em>
  good enough
 </em>
 that behaviorally, we do not experience the censored future.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="55">
 We don&rsquo;t have to learn the future in any significant way (what exactly have you &ldquo;learned&rdquo; about air travel that is not a fairly trivial port of train-travel behavior?)
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="57">
 So the way the &ldquo;future&rdquo; of air travel in 1900 actually arrived was the following:
</span>
</p>
<span class="marker" id="59">
 <ul>
  <li>
   A specialized future arrived for a subset who were trained and equipped with new mental models to comprehend it in the fullest sense, but in a narrowly instrumental rather than appreciative way.
  </li>
 </ul>
</span>
<span class="marker" id="58">
 A fighter pilot does not necessarily experience flight the way a bird does.
 <li>
  The vast majority started experiencing a manufactured normalcy, via McLuhan-esque extension of existing media
 </li>
 <li>
  Occasionally, the manufactured normalcy broke down for a few people by accident, who were then exposed to the &ldquo;future&rdquo; without being equipped to handle it
 </li>
</span><p>
<span class="marker" id="61">
 Air travel is also a convenient metaphor for the idea of existential nausea I&rsquo;ll get to.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="60">
 If you experience air travel in its true form and are not prepared for it by nature and nurture, you will throw up.
</span>

<span class="marker" id="62">
 <strong>
  The Future Arrives via Specialization and Metaphor Expansion
 </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="65">
 So this is a very different way to understand the future: it doesn&rsquo;t arrive in a temporal sense.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="64">
 It arrives mainly via social fragmentation.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="63">
 <em>
  Specialization
 </em>
 is how the future arrives.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="69">
 And in many cases, arrival-via-specialization means psychological non-arrival.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="68">
 Not every element of the future brings with it a visceral human experience that at least a subset can encounter.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="67">
 There are no &ldquo;pilots&rdquo; in the arrival of cheap gene sequencing, for instance.
</span>
At least not yet.
<span class="marker" id="66">
 When you can pay to grow a tail, that might change.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="70">
 There is a subset of humanity that routinely does DNA sequencing and similar things everyday, but if the genomic future has arrived for them, it has arrived as a clean, purely cerebral-instrumental experience, transformed into a new kind of symbol-manipulation and equipment-operation expertise.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="77">
 Arrival-via-specialization requires potential specialists.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="76">
 Presumably, humans with extra high tolerance for g-forces have always existed, and technology began selecting for that trait once airplanes were invented.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="75">
 This suggests that only those futures arrive for which there is human capacity to cope.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="74">
 This conclusion is not true, because a future can arrive before humans figure out whether they
 <em>
  have
 </em>
 the ability to cope.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="73">
 For instance, the widespread problem of obesity suggests that food-abundance arrived before we figured out that most of us cannot cope.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="72">
 And this is one piece of the future that
 <em>
  cannot
 </em>
 be relegated to specialists.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="71">
 Others cannot eat for you, even though others can fly planes for you.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="81">
 So what about elements of the future that arrive relatively successfully for everybody, like cellphones?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="80">
 Here, the idea I called the
 <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/09/23/the-milo-criterion/">
  Milo Criterion
 </a>
 kicks in: successful products are precisely those that do
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 attempt to move user experiences significantly, even if the underlying technology has shifted radically.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="79">
 In fact the whole point of user experience design is to manufacture the necessary normalcy for a product to succeed and get integrated into the Field.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="78">
 In this sense user experience design is reductive with respect to technological potential.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="84">
 So for this bucket of experiencing the future, what we get is a Darwinian weeding out of those manifestations of the future that break the continuity of technological experience.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="83">
 So things like Google Wave fail.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="82">
 Just because something is technically feasible does not mean it can psychologically normalized into the Field.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="86">
 The Web arrived via the document metaphor.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="85">
 Despite the rise of the stream metaphor for
 <em>
  conceptualizing
 </em>
 the Web architecturally, the user-experience metaphor is still descended from the document.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="88">
 The smartphone, which I understand conceptually these days via a pacifier metaphor, is
 <em>
  nothing
 </em>
 like a phone.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="87">
 Voice is just one clunky feature grandfathered into a handheld computer that is engineered to loosely resemble its nominal ancestor.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="90">
 The phone in turn was a gradual morphing of things like speaking tubes.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="89">
 This line of descent has an element of conscious design, so technological genealogy is not as deterministic as biological genealogy.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="92">
 The smartphone could have developed via metaphoric descent from the hand-held calculator; &ldquo;Oh, I can now talk to people on my calculator&rdquo; would have been a fairly natural way to understand it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="91">
 That it was the phone rather than the calculator is probably partly due to path-dependency effects and partly due to the greater ubiquity of phones in mainstream life.

<span class="marker" id="95">
 I haven&rsquo;t done a careful analysis, but my rough, back-of-the-napkin working out of the implications of these ideas suggests that we are all living, in user-experience terms, in some thoroughly mangled, overloaded, stretched and precarious version of the 15th century that is just good enough to withstand casual scrutiny.

 I&rsquo;ll qualify this a bit in a minute, but stay with me here.

 What about edge-culturists who think they are more alive to the real oncoming future?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="101">
 I am convinced that they frozen in time too.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="100">
 The edge today looks strangely similar to the edge in any previous century.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="99">
 It is  defined by reactionary musical and sartorial tastes and being a little more outrageous than everybody else in challenging the prevailing culture of manners.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="98">
 Edge-dwelling is a social rather than technological phenomenon.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="97">
 If it reveals anything about technology or the future, it is mostly by accident.

</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="102">
 Art occasionally rises to the challenge of cracking open a window onto the actual present, but mostly restricts itself to creating dissonance in the mainstream&rsquo;s view of the imagined present, a relative rather than absolute dialectic.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="104">
 Edge culturists end up living lives that are continuously repeated rehearsal loops for a future that never actually arrives.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="103">
 They do experience a version of the future a little earlier than others, but the mechanisms they need to resort to are so cumbersome, that what they actually experience is the mechanisms rather than the future as it will eventually be lived.

 For instance, the
 <em>
  <a href="http://microship.com/bike/behemoth/">

 a futuristic bicycle built by Steven Roberts in 1991, had many features that have today eventually arrived for all via the iPhone.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="105">
 So in a sense, Roberts didn&rsquo;t really experience the future ahead of us, because what shapes our experience of universal mobile communication definitely has nothing to do with a bicycle and a lot to do with pacifiers (I don&rsquo;t think Roberts had a pacifier in the
 <em>
  Behemoth

 At a more human level, I find that I am unable to relate to people who are deeply into any sort of cyberculture or other future-obsessed edge zone.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="109">
 There is a certain extreme banality to my thoughts when I think about the future.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="108">
 Futurists as a subculture seem to organize their lives as future-experience theaters.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="107">
 These theaters are perhaps entertaining and interesting in their own right, as a sort of performance art, but are not of much interest or value to people who are interested in the future in the form it might arrive in, for all.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="117">
 It is easy to make the distinction explicit.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="116">
 Most futurists are interested in the future beyond the Field.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="115">
 I am primarily interested in the future once it enters the Field, and the process by which it gets integrated into it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="114">
 This is also where the future turns into money, so perhaps my motivations are less intellectual than they are narrowly mercenary.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="113">
 This is also a more complicated way of making a point made by several marketers: technology only becomes interesting once it becomes technically boring.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="112">
 Technological futurists are pre-Fieldists.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="111">
 Marketing futurists are post-Fieldists.

 This also explains why so few futurists make any money.

 those parts of the future that are worth very little.

<span class="marker" id="119">
 Technological change serves as a basis for constructing aspirational visions of changed humanity.

 This suggests a different, subtler reading of Gibson&rsquo;s unevenly-distributed line.

<p>
<span class="marker" id="131">
 Instead, what is unevenly distributed are isolated windows into the un-normalized future that exist as weak spots in the Field.
</span>

 One separates the currently infeasible from the feasible (hyperspatial travel is unfortunately infeasible), and the other separates the normalized from the un-normalized.

 In fact,
 <em>
  the labeling of the Field as the &lsquo;present&rsquo; is itself part of the manufactured normalcy.

 The labeling serves to hide a complex construction process underneath an apparently familiar label that most of us think we experience but don&rsquo;t really (as generations of meditation teachers exhorting us to &lsquo;live in the present&rsquo; try to get across; they mostly fail because their sense of time has been largely hijacked by a cultural process).

  Field Elasticity and Attenuation

<span class="marker" id="146">
 A basic objection to my account of what you could call the &ldquo;futurism dialectic&rdquo; is that 2012 looks nothing like the fifteenth century, as we understand it today, through our best reconstructions.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="147">
 My answer to that objection is simple: as everyday experiences get mangled by layer after layer of metaphoric back-referencing, these metaphors get reified into a sort of atemporal, non-physical realm of abstract experience-primitives.
</span>
</p>
<p>

<span class="marker" id="148">
 The Field
 <em>
  stretches
 </em>
 to accommodate the future, rather than
 <em>
  moving
 </em>
 to cover it.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="160">
 It stretches in its own design space: that of ever-expanding, reifying, conceptual metaphor.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="159">
 Expansion as a basic framing suggests an entirely different set of risks and concerns.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="158">
 We needn&rsquo;t worry about acceleration.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="157">
 We need to worry about attenuation.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="156">
 We need not worry about not being able to &ldquo;keep up&rdquo; with a present that moves faster.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="155">
 We need to worry about the Field expanding to a breaking point and popping, like an over-inflated balloon.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="154">
 We need not worry about computers getting ever faster.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="153">
 We need to worry about the document metaphor breaking suddenly, leaving us unable to comprehend the Internet.

 Dating the &ldquo;planetary UX&rdquo; to the fifteenth century is something like chronological anchoring of the genealogy of extant metaphors to the nearest historical point where some recognizable physical basis exists.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="162">
 The 15th century is sort of the Garden of Eden of the modern experience of technology.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="161">
 It represents the point where our current balloon started to get inflated.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="164">
 When we  think of differences between historical periods, we tend to focus on the most superficial of human differences that have very little coupling to technological progress.

 Quick, imagine the fifteenth century.

</span>
<span class="marker" id="176">
 Item 3 will not be translatable at all.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="180">
 But this does not mean that he does not understand your present.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="179">
 It means
 <em>
  you

 do not understand your own present in any meaningful way.

 You are merely able to function within it.

 <strong>
  Appreciative versus Instrumental Comprehension
 </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="183">
 If your understanding of the present were a coherent understanding and appreciation of your reality, you would be able to communicate it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="182">
 I am going to borrow
 <a href="http://www.tempobook.com/2012/06/11/appreciative-versus-manipulative-mental-models/">
  terms from John Friedman
 </a>
 and distinguish between two sorts of conceptual metaphors we use to comprehend present reality: appreciative and instrumental.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="186">
 Instrumental (what Friedman misleadingly called
 <em>
  manipulative
 </em>
 ) conceptual metaphors are basic UX metaphors like &ldquo;scrolling&rdquo; web pages, or the metaphor of the &ldquo;keypad&rdquo; on a phone.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="185">
 Appreciative conceptual metaphors help us understand present realities in terms of their fundamental dynamics.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="184">
 So my use of the metaphor &ldquo;smartphones are pacifiers&rdquo; (it
 <em>
  looks
 </em>
 like a figurative metaphor, but once you get used to it, you find that it has the natural depth of a classic Lakoff conceptual metaphor) is an appreciative conceptual metaphor.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="188">
 Instrumental conceptual metaphors allow us to function.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="187">
 Appreciative ones allow us to make sense of our lives and communicate such understanding.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="189">
 So our failure to communicate the idea of Instagram to somebody in 3000 BC is due to an atemporal and asymmetric incomprehension: we possess good instrumental metaphors but poor appreciative ones.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="192">
 So this failure has less to do with Arthur C.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="191">
 Clarke&rsquo;s famous assertion that a sufficiently advanced technology will seem like magic to those from more primitive eras, and more to do with the fact that the Field actively prevents us from ever understanding our own present on its own terms.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="190">
 We manage to function and comprehend reality in instrumental ways while falling behind in comprehending it in appreciative ways.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="194">
 So my update to Clarke would be this:
 <em>
  any sufficiently advanced technology will seem like magic to all humans at all times.
 </em>
</span>
<span class="marker" id="193">
 Some will merely live within a Field that allow them to
 <em>
  function
 </em>
 within specific advanced technology environments.
</span>
</p>
<p>
Take item 4 for instance.
<span class="marker" id="197">
 After all, it is Insta
 <em>
  gram,
 </em>
 a reference to a telegram.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="196">
 We understand Facebook in terms of school
 <em>
  year-books.
 </em>
</span>
<span class="marker" id="195">
 It is exactly this sort of pattern of purely instrumental comprehension that leads to the plausibility of certain types of Internet hoaxes, like the one that did the rounds recently about Abraham Lincoln having patented a version of the Facebook idea.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="199">
 The fact that the core idea of Facebook can be translated to the language of Abe&rsquo;s world of newspapers suggests that we are papering over (I had to, sorry) complicated realities with surfaces we can understand.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="198">
 The alternative conclusion is silly (that the technology underlying Facebook is not really more expressive than the one underlying newspapers).
</span>
</p>
<p>
Facebook is not a Yearbook.
<span class="marker" id="202">
 It is a few warehouse-sized buildings containing racks and racks of electronic hardware sheets, each containing etched little slivers of silicon at their core.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="201">
 Each of those little slivers contains more intricacy than all the jewelry designers in history together managed to put into all the earrings they ever made.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="200">
 These warehouses are connected via radio and optic-fiber links to&hellip;.
</span>
</p>
<p>
Oh well, forget it.
<span class="marker" id="204">
 It&rsquo;s a frikkin&rsquo; Yearbook that contains everybody.

<strong>
 The Always-Unreal
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="208">
 Have you ever wondered why Alvin Toffler&rsquo;s writings seem so strange today?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="207">
 Intellectually you can recognize that he saw a lot of things coming.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="206">
 But somehow, he imagined the future in
 <em>
  future-unfamiliar
 </em>
 terms.
</span>
So it appears
<em>
 strange
</em>
to us.
<span class="marker" id="205">
 Because we are experiencing a lot of what he saw coming, translated into terms that would actually have been completely
 <em>
  familiar
 </em>
 to him.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="210">
 His writings seem unreal partly because they are impoverished imaginings of things that did not exist back then, but also partly because his writing seems to be informed by the idea that the future would define itself.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="209">
 He speaks of future-concepts like (say) modular housing in terms that make sense with respect to those concepts.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="214">
 When the future actually arrived, in the form of couchsurfing and Airbnb, it arrived translated into a crazed-familiarity.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="213">
 Toffler sort of got the basic idea that mobility would change our sense of home.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="212">
 His failure was not in failing to predict how housing might evolve.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="211">
 His failure was in failing to predict that we would comprehend it in terms of &ldquo;Bed and Breakfast&rdquo; metaphors.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="216">
 This is not an indictment of Toffler&rsquo;s skill as a futurist, but of the very
 <em>
  methods
 </em>
 of futurism.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="215">
 We build conceptual models of the world as it exists today, posit laws of transformation and change,  simulate possible futures, and cherry-pick interesting and likely-sounding elements that appear robustly across many simulations and appear feasible.
</span>
</p>
<p>
And then we stop.
<span class="marker" id="218">
 We do not transform the end-state conceptual models into the behavioral terms we use to actually engage and understand reality-in-use, as opposed to reality-in-contemplation.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="217">
 We forget to do the most important part of a futurist prediction: predicting how user experience might evolve to normalize the future-unfamiliar.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="220">
 Something similar happens with even the best of science fiction.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="219">
 There is a strangeness to the imagining that seems missing when the imagined futures finally arrive, pre-processed into the familiar.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="224">
 But here, something slightly different plays out, because the future is presented in the context of imaginary human characters facing up to timeless Campbellian human challenges.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="223">
 So we have characters living out lives involving very strange behaviors in strange landscapes, wearing strange clothes, and so forth.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="222">
 This is what makes science fiction
 <em>
  science
 </em>
 fiction after all.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="221">
 George Lucas&rsquo; space opera is interesting precisely because it is
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 set in the Wild West or Mt.
</span>
Olympus.
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="226">
 We turn imagined behavioral differences that the future might bring into entertainment, but when it actually arrives, we make sure the behavioral differences are minimized.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="225">
 The Field creates a suspension of potential disbelief.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="230">
 So both futurism and science fiction are trapped in an always-unreal strange land that must always exist at a certain remove from the manufactured-to-be-familiar present.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="229">
 Much of present-moment science fiction and fantasy is in fact forced into parallel universe territory not because there are deep philosophical counterfactuals involved (a lot of
 <em>
  Harry Potter
 </em>
 magic is very functionally replicable by us Muggles) but because it would lose its capacity to stimulate.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="228">
 Do you really want to read about a newspaper made of flexible e-ink that plays black-and-white movies over WiFi?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="227">
 That sounds like a bad startup pitch rather than a good fantasy novel.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="231">
 <em>
  The Matrix
 </em>
 was something of an interesting triumph in this sense, and in a way smarter than one of its inspirations,
 <em>
  The Neuromancer,
 </em>
 because it made Gibson&rsquo;s cyberspace co-incident with a temporally frozen reality-simulacrum.
</span>
</p>
<p>
But it  did not go far enough.
<span class="marker" id="232">
 The world of 1997 (or wherever the
 <em>
  Matrix
 </em>
 decided to hit &lsquo;Pause&rsquo;) was itself never an experienced reality.
</span>
</p>
<p>
1997 never happened. Neither did 1500 in a way.
<span class="marker" id="234">
 What we did have was different stretched states of the Manufactured Normalcy Field in 1500 and 1997.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="233">
 If the
 <em>
  Matrix
 </em>
 were to happen, it would have to actually keep that stretching going.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
 Breathless
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="236">
 There
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 one element of the future that does arrive on schedule, uncensored.
</span>
This is its emotional quality.
<span class="marker" id="235">
 The pace of change is accelerating and we experience this as Field-stretching anxiety.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="238">
 But emotions being what they are, we cannot separate future anxiety from other forms of anxiety.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="237">
 Are you upset today because your boss yelled at you or because subtle cues made the accelerating pace of change leak into your life as a tear in the Field?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="240">
 Increased anxiety is only one dimension of how we experience change.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="239">
 Another dimension is a constant sense of crisis (which has, incidentally, always prevailed in history).
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="241">
 A third dimension is a constant feeling of chaos held at bay (another constant in history), just beyond the firewall of everyday routine (the Field
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 everyday routine).
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="246">
 Sometimes we experience the future via a basic individual-level &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t happen to me&rdquo; normalcy bias.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="245">
 Things like SARS or dying in a plane crash are uncomprehended future-things (remember, you live in a manufactured reality that has been stretching since the fifteenth century)  that are nominally in our present, but haven&rsquo;t penetrated the Field for most of us.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="244">
 Most of us substitute probability for time in such cases.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="243">
 As time progresses, the long tail of the unexperienced future grows fatter.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="242">
 A lot more
 <em>
  can
 </em>
 happen to us in 2012 than in 1500, but we try to ensure that very little
 <em>
  does
 </em>
 happen.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="247">
 The uncertainty of the future is about this long tail of waiting events that the Field hasn&rsquo;t yet digested, but we know exists out there, as a space where Bad Things Happen to People Like Me but Never to Me.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="249">
 In a way, when we ask,
 <em>
  is there a sustainable future,
 </em>
 we are not really asking about fossil fuels or feeding 9 billion people.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="248">
 We are asking
 <em>
  can the Manufactured Normalcy Field absorb such and such changes?
 </em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="255">
 We aren&rsquo;t really tied to specific elements of today&rsquo;s lifestyles.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="254">
 We are definitely open to change.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="253">
 But only change that comes to us via the Field.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="252">
 We&rsquo;ve adapted to the idea of people cutting open our bodies, stopping our hearts and pumping our blood through machines while they cut us up.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="251">
 The Field has digested
 <em>
  those
 </em>
 realities.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="250">
 Various sorts of existential anesthetics are an important part of how the Field is manufactured and maintained.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="256">
 Our sense of impending doom or extraordinary potential have to do with the perceived fragility or robustness of the Field.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="258">
 It is possible to slide into a sort of technological solipsism here and declare that there is no reality; that only the Field exists.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="257">
 Many postmodernists do exactly that.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="263">
 Except that history repeatedly proves them wrong.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="262">
 The Field
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 distinct from reality.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="261">
 It
 <em>
  can
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  does
 </em>
 break down a couple of times in every human lifetime.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="260">
 We&rsquo;re coming off a very long period &mdash; since World War II &mdash; of Field stability.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="259">
 Except for a few poor schmucks in places like Vietnam, the Field has been precariously preserved for most of us.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="266">
 When larger global Fields break, we experience &ldquo;dark&rdquo; ages.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="265">
 We literally cannot process change at all.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="264">
 We grope, waiting for an age when it will all make sense again.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="270">
 So we could be entering a Dark Age right now, because most of us don&rsquo;t experience a global Field anymore.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="269">
 We live in tiny personal fields.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="268">
 We can only connect socially with people whose little-f fields are similar to ours.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="267">
 When individual fields also start popping, psychic chaos will start to loom.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="271">
 The scary possibility in the near future is not that we will see another radical break in the Field, but a permanent collapse of all fields, big and small.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="275">
 The result will be a state of constant psychological warfare between the present and the future, where reality changes far too fast for either a global Field or a personal one to keep up.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="274">
 Where adaptation-by-specialization turns into a crazed, continuous reinvention of oneself for survival.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="273">
 Where the reinvention is sufficient to sustain existence financially, but not sufficient to maintain continuity of present-experience.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="272">
 Instrumental metaphors will persist while appreciative ones will collapse entirely.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="276">
 The result will be a world population with a large majority of people on the edge of madness, somehow functioning in a haze where past, present and future form a chaotic soup (have you checked out your Facebook feed lately?) of drunken perspective shifts.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="278">
 This is already starting to happen.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="277">
 Instead of a newspaper feeding us daily doses of a shared Field, we get a nauseating mix of news from forgotten classmates, slogan-placards about issues trivial and grave, revisionist histories coming at us via a million political voices, the future as a patchwork quilt of incoherent glimpses, all mixed in with pictures of cats doing improbable things.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="279">
 The waning Field, still coming at us through weakening media like television, seems increasingly like a surreal zone of Wonderland madness.

 Throughout evolutionary history, most adult homo sapiens could not drink milk.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="3">
 Even today, most adults cannot drink milk.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="2">
 Adults who cannot drink milk don&rsquo;t seem to lose very much, particularly as they can still eat yogurt and cheese.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="1">
 And yet the gene that allowed some adults to drink milk spread incredibly rapidly suggesting massive advantages to milk drinkers.
</span>
Why?

 No one knows for sure but it seems to coincide with civilization.

 [A]round 10,000 B.C&hellip;.a genetic mutation appeared, somewhere near modern-day Turkey, that jammed the lactase-production gene permanently in the &ldquo;on&rdquo; position.

 The original mutant was

  probably a male

 who passed the gene on to his children.

<span class="marker" id="7">
 People carrying the mutation could drink milk their entire lives.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="6">
 Genomic analyses have shown that within a few thousand years, at a rate that evolutionary biologists had thought impossibly rapid, this mutation spread throughout Eurasia, to Great Britain, Scandinavia, the Mediterranean, India and all points in between, stopping only at the Himalayas.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="5">
 Independently, other mutations for lactose tolerance arose in Africa and the Middle East, though not in the Americas, Australia, or the Far East.

 In an evolutionary eye-blink, 80 percent of Europeans became milk-drinkers; in

 (Though globally, lactose intolerance is the norm; around two-thirds of humans cannot drink milk in adulthood.) The speed of this transformation is one of the weirder mysteries in the story of human evolution, more so because it&rsquo;s not clear why anybody needed the mutation to begin with.

<span class="marker" id="16">
 &hellip;A &ldquo;high selection differential&rdquo; is something of a Darwinian euphemism.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="15">
 It means that those who couldn&rsquo;t drink milk were apt to die before they could reproduce.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="14">
 At best they were having fewer, sicklier children.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="13">
 That kind of life-or-death selection differential seems necessary to explain the speed with which the mutation swept across Eurasia and spread even faster in Africa.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="12">
 The unfit must have been taking their lactose-intolerant genomes to the grave.

 Western civilization, which is twinned with agriculture, seems to have required milk to begin functioning.

No one can say why.

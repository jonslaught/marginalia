<p>Five years ago, Joe Fernandez, at 30, had jaw surgery. His mouth was wired shut for three months and he couldn’t carry on a conversation. He immersed himself in the online world, and realized that unlike every other form of broadcast media there was no way to measure the impact of its key element—people. There were countless communicators who had online sway, people worth taking note of. But many were unsung and unmeasured. He decided to quantify that influence. </p>
<p>Now he has a reasonably successful Internet company called Klout. It uses data from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Google+, Blogger and other sources to boil down influence to a single number on a scale of a 100. (Until recently Justin Bieber had a perfect score.) Millions of people check how they’re doing on Klout. Sponsors give freebies to high-scoring Klouters to spread word of mouth. (Latest: free access to American Airlines Admirals Club.) Investors have poured an estimated $40 million into the company. A story in Wired last year said Klout is “at the forefront of a new and extremely promising online industry.” </p>
<p>But Joe Fernandez knows it’s not enough. </p>
<p>He sees Klout’s mission as empowering people to maximize their influence. So far, though, the service has mostly been about quantifying and reporting. People visit the site not to do anything, but to ego-surf. (“You feel somewhat dirty,” Fernandez admits.) He wants to change that—by making Klout much more than just a yardstick to measuring influence. “I want to do something important on the Internet,” he says. (Quickly adding that he doesn’t mean that scoring influence isn’t, um, important.) </p>
<p>Perhaps more to the point, there’s only so far Klout can go in a business sense by simply being a scorekeeper. There’s persistent skepticism about the relevance of boiling down online influence to a single number. A recent study by NYU Stern School assistant professor Sinan Aral found that “traditional models overestimated the power of influence by a factor of seven.” Aral reports that while most of his students follow Ashton Kutcher on Twitter, almost none of them have ever done anything @aplusk suggested.</p>
<p>Solution? The scorekeeper wants to get in the game. </p>
<p>So as of today, Klout is conducting something of a pivot. Klout scores will still be around, but the site is transmogrifying into a service where people can get questions answered by experts. </p>
<p>In other words, Klout is vying for status as a social network itself, not just a place that scores other networks. It’s as if the Nielsen Company suddenly began commissioning television sitcoms. Or the Gallup Poll ran a slate of candidates. “We built the Internet standard for influence and reputation, but didn’t have consumer utility,” says Fernandez. “It’s a big step for our company. It’s also an internally scary transition—from being focused on the score to trying to be a utility for the world.”</p>

<p>How does this new service, called Klout Experts, work? For the past few months, visitors to the Klout website, vanity-trolling for their ratings, have been notified that “someone” has asked them a question, and provides a space to answer in 300 characters or less. So far there’s been only been a thousand or so questions, but Fernandez says that will soon increase to thousands a day. People are answering those questions, and in the next few months the database of answers will climb into the millions. Klout will soon be able to match popular questions with answers, rate them, and deliver better answer. It will also identify which experts are best—allowing sponsors will to target them as influencers. </p>
<p>Next will come instant answers. Klout will ping experts when someone is asking a question they know something about. “I’m terrible at tools,” says Fernandez. “In about a year from now, I hope that when I’m at Home Depot, I can pull out my phone, get an influencer in real time, and have a two-minute conversation about what to buy.” Eventually Fernandez hopes the site becomes a thriving bazaar for questions and answers. Presumably, advertisers will be able to target ads to exchanges relevant to their products—just at the moment when people are interested.</p>
<p>In part because of that huge advertising potential, answering questions is the passion of Internet companies big and small. Klout’s new competition is broad and formidable. Google supplies over 30 million links to the query, “How do I boil water?” Quora is built on questions; for instance, ninety-nine thoughtful people have responded to a Quora question, “Is getting rich worth it?” (Fernandez says that Quora’s questions are more “existential” than Klout’s nuts-and-bolts-y queries.) Content assembly lines like Demand Media have knocked off millions of pithy answers to every stupid question you can imagine. There’s a particularly avid passel of costly services that specialize in expert answers. </p>
<p>Klout argues that its edge will be the implicit promise that providing good answers will boost your influence and thereby your score. There’s a weird element of recursion in this: In addition to gauging your mojo on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and the rest, Klout will be measuring Klout clout. “We think of it agnostically as compared to the other score sites,” says Fernandez. “We’re just another network that has its own weights and issues.” </p>
<p>But there’s another incentive for Klout users to answer questions: the best answers will also reach a new audience. Klout has a partnership with Bing that gives Microsoft’s search engine access to answers from Klout experts. In fact, so far most of the questions posed to Klout users have come from Microsoft, drawn from popular Bing request. “It’s part of our social search effort,” says Lawrence Ripsher, a Bing executive. “”We’ve already integrated existing content. The next step is creating content with searches in mind.” </p>
<p>This evokes answer mills like Demand Media. But instead of paying freelancers to churn out quick little articles for a couple of bucks each, Klout and Bing are getting people to share their expertise for free. “We own the answer,” says Fernandez. ‘You’re free to share it anywhere, do whatever you want with it–but we are also building a database.” </p>
<p>Users do get the benefit of exposure. That’s what the lure is for Yolanda Vanveen, a gardening maven who lives near Portland, Oregon. She’s already a deft social media user, particularly on YouTube, where she has posted over 1000 videos. Her Klout score is an excellent 74. (Welcome to the Admiral’s Club!) Now, by answering Klout Expert questions like “What’s the best way to care for tulips?” she can raise it higher and provide answers to Klout users. Even better, Bing users may get her wisdom ranked higher than any source in the world—and there also will be a link to her Klout page. “I’m ecstatic about that,” says Vanveen. “I want to get my sustainable gardening message out.”</p>
<p>Joe Fernandez hopes that there are plenty of Yolanda Vanveens out there. He also hopes that the self-selected group of people who jack up their Klout score by answering questions won’t give the impression that the entire scoring system is somewhat polluted. Most of all, he’s betting that his new system will make people change their habits and seek answers from Klout Experts.</p>
<p>Win or lose, Klout is now playing the game, and not just keeping score.</p>

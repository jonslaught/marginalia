<p>Throughout evolutionary history, most adult homo sapiens could not drink milk. Even today, most adults cannot drink milk. Adults who cannot drink milk don’t seem to lose very much, particularly as they can still eat yogurt and cheese. And yet the gene that allowed some adults to drink milk spread incredibly rapidly suggesting massive advantages to milk drinkers. Why? No one knows for sure but it seems to coincide with civilization. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_evolution/2012/10/evolution_of_lactose_tolerance_why_do_humans_keep_drinking_milk.single.html">Slate has more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A]round 10,000 B.C….a genetic mutation appeared, somewhere near modern-day Turkey, that jammed the lactase-production gene permanently in the “on” position. The original mutant was <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120824103020.htm" target="_blank">probably a male</a> who passed the gene on to his children. People carrying the mutation could drink milk their entire lives. Genomic analyses have shown that within a few thousand years, at a rate that evolutionary biologists had thought impossibly rapid, this mutation spread throughout Eurasia, to Great Britain, Scandinavia, the Mediterranean, India and all points in between, stopping only at the Himalayas. Independently, other mutations for lactose tolerance arose in Africa and the Middle East, though not in the Americas, Australia, or the Far East.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In an evolutionary eye-blink, 80 percent of Europeans became milk-drinkers; in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" target="_blank">some</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden" target="_blank"> populations</a>, the proportion is close to 100 percent. (Though globally, lactose intolerance is the norm; around two-thirds of humans cannot drink milk in adulthood.) The speed of this transformation is one of the weirder mysteries in the story of human evolution, more so because it’s not clear why anybody needed the mutation to begin with.</p>
<p>…A “high selection differential” is something of a Darwinian euphemism. It means that those who couldn’t drink milk were apt to die before they could reproduce. At best they were having fewer, sicklier children. That kind of life-or-death selection differential seems necessary to explain the speed with which the mutation swept across Eurasia and spread even faster in Africa. The unfit must have been taking their lactose-intolerant genomes to the grave.</p>
<p>…The rise of civilization coincided with a strange twist in our evolutionary history. We became, in the coinage of one paleoanthropologist, “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IaflsA4MyFQC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=mampires+harpending&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uoZjcyfXA5&amp;sig=F8vz1CtVCpdcLibWsUJv7M6QTNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PJOBUKHKL4ai8QT31YHwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mampires%20harpending&amp;f=false" target="_blank">mampires</a>” who feed on the fluids of other animals. Western civilization, which is twinned with agriculture, seems to have required milk to begin functioning. No one can say why.</p></blockquote>

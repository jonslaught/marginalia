<p><mark id="0"><i>(This essay is derived from a talk at the 2005 <a href="http://startupschool.org">Startup School.</a>)</i></mark></p>
<p><mark id="2">How do you get good ideas for <a href="start.html">startups</a>?</mark> <mark id="1">That's probably the number one question people ask me.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="3">I'd like to reply with another question: why do people think it's hard to come up with ideas for startups?</mark></p>
<p><mark id="5">That might seem a stupid thing to ask.</mark> Why do they <i>think</i> it's hard? <mark id="4">If people can't do it, then it <i>is</i> hard, at least for them.</mark> Right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe not. <mark id="8">What people usually say is not that they can't think of ideas, but that they don't have any.</mark> <mark id="7">That's not quite the same thing.</mark> <mark id="6">It could be the reason they don't have any is that they haven't tried to generate them.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="11">I think this is often the case.</mark> <mark id="10">I think people believe that coming up with ideas for startups is very hard-- that it <i>must</i> be very hard-- and so they don't try do to it.</mark> <mark id="9">They assume ideas are like miracles: they either pop into your head or they don't.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="14">I also have a theory about why people think this.</mark> They overvalue ideas. <mark id="13">They think creating a startup is just a matter of implementing some fabulous initial idea.</mark> <mark id="12">And since a successful startup is worth millions of dollars, a good idea is therefore a million dollar idea.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="16">If coming up with an idea for a startup equals coming up with a million dollar idea, then of course it's going to seem hard.</mark> Too hard to bother trying. <mark id="15">Our instincts tell us something so valuable would not be just lying around for anyone to discover.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="20">Actually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here's an experiment you can try to prove it: just try to sell one.</mark> <mark id="19">Nothing evolves faster than markets.</mark> <mark id="18">The fact that there's no market for startup ideas suggests there's no demand.</mark> <mark id="17">Which means, in the narrow sense of the word, that startup ideas are worthless.</mark></p>
<p><b>Questions</b></p>
<p><mark id="22">The fact is, most startups end up nothing like the initial idea.</mark> <mark id="21">It would be closer to the truth to say the main value of your initial idea is that, in the process of discovering it's broken, you'll come up with your real idea.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="26">The initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but a question.</mark> <mark id="25">It might help if they were expressed that way.</mark> <mark id="24">Instead of saying that your idea is to make a collaborative, web-based spreadsheet, say: could one make a collaborative, web-based spreadsheet?</mark> <mark id="23">A few grammatical tweaks, and a woefully incomplete idea becomes a promising question to explore.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="28">There's a real difference, because an assertion provokes objections in a way a question doesn't.</mark> <mark id="27">If you say: I'm going to build a web-based spreadsheet, then critics-- the most dangerous of which are in your own head-- will immediately reply that you'd be competing with Microsoft, that you couldn't give people the kind of UI they expect, that users wouldn't want to have their data on your servers, and so on.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="34">A question doesn't seem so challenging.</mark> <mark id="33">It becomes: let's try making a web-based spreadsheet and see how far we get.</mark> <mark id="32">And everyone knows that if you tried this you'd be able to make <i>something</i> useful.</mark> <mark id="31">Maybe what you'd end up with wouldn't even be a spreadsheet.</mark> <mark id="30">Maybe it would be some kind of new spreasheet-like collaboration tool that doesn't even have a name yet.</mark> <mark id="29">You wouldn't have thought of something like that except by implementing your way toward it.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="37">Treating a startup idea as a question changes what you're looking for.</mark> <mark id="36">If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right.</mark> <mark id="35">But if it's a question, it can be wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to more ideas.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="40">One valuable way for an idea to be wrong is to be only a partial solution.</mark> <mark id="39">When someone's working on a problem that seems too big, I always ask: is there some way to bite off some subset of the problem, then gradually expand from there?</mark> <mark id="38">That will generally work unless you get trapped on a local maximum, like 1980s-style AI, or C.</mark></p>
<p><b>Upwind</b></p>
<p><mark id="42">So far, we've reduced the problem from thinking of a million dollar idea to thinking of a mistaken question.</mark> <mark id="41">That doesn't seem so hard, does it?</mark></p>
<p><mark id="44">To generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with promising new technologies, and to have the right kind of friends.</mark> <mark id="43">New technologies are the ingredients startup ideas are made of, and conversations with friends are the kitchen they're cooked in.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="47">Universities have both, and that's why so many startups grow out of them.</mark> <mark id="46">They're filled with new technologies, because they're trying to produce research, and only things that are new count as research.</mark> <mark id="45">And they're full of exactly the right kind of people to have ideas with: the other students, who will be not only smart but elastic-minded to a fault.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="49">The opposite extreme would be a well-paying but boring job at a big company.</mark> <mark id="48">Big companies are biased against new technologies, and the people you'd meet there would be wrong too.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="51">In an <a href="hs.html">essay</a> I wrote for high school students, I said a good rule of thumb was to stay upwind-- to work on things that maximize your future options.</mark> <mark id="50">The principle applies for adults too, though perhaps it has to be modified to: stay upwind for as long as you can, then cash in the potential energy you've accumulated when you need to pay for kids.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="54">I don't think people consciously realize this, but one reason downwind jobs like churning out Java for a bank pay so well is precisely that they are downwind.</mark> <mark id="53">The market price for that kind of work is higher because it gives you fewer options for the future.</mark> <mark id="52">A job that lets you work on exciting new stuff will tend to pay less, because part of the compensation is in the form of the new skills you'll learn.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="56">Grad school is the other end of the spectrum from a coding job at a big company: the pay's low but you spend most of your time working on new stuff.</mark> <mark id="55">And of course, it's called "school," which makes that clear to everyone, though in fact all jobs are some percentage school.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="58">The right environment for having startup ideas need not be a university per se.</mark> <mark id="57">It just has to be a situation with a large percentage of school.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="63">It's obvious why you want exposure to new technology, but why do you need other people?</mark> <mark id="62">Can't you just think of new ideas yourself?</mark> The empirical answer is: no. <mark id="61">Even Einstein needed people to bounce ideas off.</mark> <mark id="60">Ideas get developed in the process of explaining them to the right kind of person.</mark> <mark id="59">You need that resistance, just as a carver needs the resistance of the wood.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="66">This is one reason Y Combinator has a rule against investing in startups with only one founder.</mark> <mark id="65">Practically every successful company has at least two.</mark> <mark id="64">And because startup founders work under great pressure, it's critical they be friends.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="69">I didn't realize it till I was writing this, but that may help explain why there are so few female startup founders.</mark> <mark id="68">I read on the Internet (so it must be true) that only 1.7% of VC-backed startups are founded by women.</mark> <mark id="67">The percentage of female hackers is small, but not that small.</mark> So why the discrepancy?</p>
<p><mark id="71">When you realize that successful startups tend to have multiple founders who were already friends, a possible explanation emerges.</mark> <mark id="70">People's best friends are likely to be of the same sex, and if one group is a minority in some population, <i>pairs</i> of them will be a minority squared.</mark> [<a href="#f1n">1</a>]</p>
<p><b>Doodling</b></p>
<p><mark id="76">What these groups of co-founders do together is more complicated than just sitting down and trying to think of ideas.</mark> <mark id="75">I suspect the most productive setup is a kind of together-alone-together sandwich.</mark> <mark id="74">Together you talk about some hard problem, probably getting nowhere.</mark> <mark id="73">Then, the next morning, one of you has an idea in the shower about how to solve it.</mark> <mark id="72">He runs eagerly to to tell the others, and together they work out the kinks.</mark></p>
<p>What happens in that shower? <mark id="77">It seems to me that ideas just pop into my head.</mark> But can we say more than that?</p>
<p><mark id="80">Taking a shower is like a form of meditation.</mark> <mark id="79">You're alert, but there's nothing to distract you.</mark> <mark id="78">It's in a situation like this, where your mind is free to roam, that it bumps into new ideas.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="85">What happens when your mind wanders?</mark> It may be like doodling. <mark id="84">Most people have characteristic ways of doodling.</mark> <mark id="83">This habit is unconscious, but not random: I found my doodles changed after I started studying painting.</mark> <mark id="82">I started to make the kind of gestures I'd make if I were drawing from life.</mark> <mark id="81">They were atoms of drawing, but arranged randomly.</mark> [<a href="#f2n">2</a>]</p>
<p><mark id="89">Perhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas.</mark> <mark id="88">You have certain mental gestures you've learned in your work, and when you're not paying attention, you keep making these same gestures, but somewhat randomly.</mark> <mark id="87">In effect, you call the same functions on random arguments.</mark> <mark id="86">That's what a metaphor is: a function applied to an argument of the wrong type.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="93">Conveniently, as I was writing this, my mind wandered: would it be useful to have metaphors in a programming language?</mark> <mark id="92">I don't know; I don't have time to think about this.</mark> <mark id="91">But it's convenient because this is an example of what I mean by habits of mind.</mark> <mark id="90">I spend a lot of time thinking about language design, and my habit of always asking "would x be useful in a programming language" just got invoked.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="96">If new ideas arise like doodles, this would explain why you have to work at something for a while before you have any.</mark> <mark id="95">It's not just that you can't judge ideas till you're an expert in a field.</mark> <mark id="94">You won't even generate ideas, because you won't have any habits of mind to invoke.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="103">Of course the habits of mind you invoke on some field don't have to be derived from working in that field.</mark> <mark id="102">In fact, it's often better if they're not.</mark> <mark id="101">You're not just looking for good ideas, but for good <i>new</i> ideas, and you have a better chance of generating those if you combine stuff from distant fields.</mark> <mark id="100">As hackers, one of our habits of mind is to ask, could one open-source x?</mark> <mark id="99">For example, what if you made an open-source operating system?</mark> <mark id="98">A fine idea, but not very novel.</mark> <mark id="97">Whereas if you ask, could you make an open-source play?</mark> you might be onto something.</p>
<p><mark id="110">Are some kinds of work better sources of habits of mind than others?</mark> <mark id="109">I suspect harder fields may be better sources, because to attack hard problems you need powerful solvents.</mark> <mark id="108">I find math is a good source of metaphors-- good enough that it's worth studying just for that.</mark> <mark id="107">Related fields are also good sources, especially when they're related in unexpected ways.</mark> <mark id="106">Everyone knows computer science and electrical engineering are related, but precisely because everyone knows it, importing ideas from one to the other doesn't yield great profits.</mark> <mark id="105">It's like importing something from Wisconsin to Michigan.</mark> <mark id="104">Whereas (I claim) hacking and <a href="hp.html">painting</a> are also related, in the sense that hackers and painters are both <a href="taste.html">makers</a>, and this source of new ideas is practically virgin territory.</mark></p>
<p><b>Problems</b></p>
<p><mark id="117">In theory you could stick together ideas at random and see what you came up with.</mark> <mark id="116">What if you built a peer-to-peer dating site?</mark> <mark id="115">Would it be useful to have an automatic book?</mark> <mark id="114">Could you turn theorems into a commodity?</mark> <mark id="113">When you assemble ideas at random like this, they may not be just stupid, but semantically ill-formed.</mark> <mark id="112">What would it even mean to make theorems a commodity?</mark> You got me. <mark id="111">I didn't think of that idea, just its name.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="120">You might come up with something useful this way, but I never have.</mark> <mark id="119">It's like knowing a fabulous sculpture is hidden inside a block of marble, and all you have to do is remove the marble that isn't part of it.</mark> <mark id="118">It's an encouraging thought, because it reminds you there is an answer, but it's not much use in practice because the search space is too big.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="123">I find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem.</mark> <mark id="122">You can't start with randomness.</mark> <mark id="121">You have to start with a problem, then let your mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="128">In a way, it's harder to see problems than their solutions.</mark> <mark id="127">Most people prefer to remain in denial about problems.</mark> <mark id="126">It's obvious why: problems are irritating.</mark> They're problems! <mark id="125">Imagine if people in 1700 saw their lives the way we'd see them.</mark> It would have been unbearable. <mark id="124">This denial is such a powerful force that, even when presented with possible solutions, people often prefer to believe they wouldn't work.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="130">I saw this phenomenon when I worked on spam filters.</mark> <mark id="129">In 2002, most people preferred to ignore spam, and most of those who didn't preferred to believe the heuristic filters then available were the best you could do.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="135">I found spam intolerable, and I felt it had to be possible to recognize it statistically.</mark> <mark id="134">And it turns out that was all you needed to solve the problem.</mark> <mark id="133">The algorithm I used was ridiculously simple.</mark> <mark id="132">Anyone who'd really tried to solve the problem would have found it.</mark> <mark id="131">It was just that no one had really tried to solve the problem.</mark> [<a href="#f3n">3</a>]</p>
<p><mark id="137">Let me repeat that recipe: finding the problem intolerable and feeling it must be possible to solve it.</mark> <mark id="136">Simple as it seems, that's the recipe for a lot of startup ideas.</mark></p>
<p><b>Wealth</b></p>
<p><mark id="141">So far most of what I've said applies to ideas in general.</mark> <mark id="140">What's special about startup ideas?</mark> <mark id="139">Startup ideas are ideas for companies, and companies have to make money.</mark> <mark id="138">And the way to make money is to make something people want.</mark></p>
<p>Wealth is what people want. <mark id="142">I don't mean that as some kind of philosophical statement; I mean it as a tautology.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="148">So an idea for a startup is an idea for something people want.</mark> <mark id="147">Wouldn't any good idea be something people want?</mark> Unfortunately not. <mark id="146">I think new theorems are a fine thing to create, but there is no great demand for them.</mark> <mark id="145">Whereas there appears to be great demand for celebrity gossip magazines.</mark> <mark id="144">Wealth is defined democratically.</mark> <mark id="143">Good ideas and valuable ideas are not quite the same thing; the difference is individual tastes.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="151">But valuable ideas are very close to good ideas, especially in technology.</mark> <mark id="150">I think they're so close that you can get away with working as if the goal were to discover good ideas, so long as, in the final stage, you stop and ask: will people actually pay for this?</mark> <mark id="149">Only a few ideas are likely to make it that far and then get shot down; RPN calculators might be one example.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="155">One way to make something people want is to look at stuff people use now that's broken.</mark> <mark id="154">Dating sites are a prime example.</mark> <mark id="153">They have millions of users, so they must be promising something people want.</mark> And yet they work horribly. Just ask anyone who uses them. <mark id="152">It's as if they used the worse-is-better approach but stopped after the first stage and handed the thing over to marketers.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="162">Of course, the most obvious breakage in the average computer user's life is Windows itself.</mark> <mark id="161">But this is a special case: you can't defeat a monopoly by a frontal attack.</mark> <mark id="160">Windows can and will be overthrown, but not by giving people a better desktop OS.</mark> <mark id="159">The way to kill it is to redefine the problem as a superset of the current one.</mark> <mark id="158">The problem is not, what operating system should people use on desktop computers?</mark> <mark id="157">but how should people use applications?</mark> <mark id="156">There are answers to that question that don't even involve desktop computers.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="164">Everyone thinks Google is going to solve this problem, but it is a very subtle one, so subtle that a company as big as Google might well get it wrong.</mark> <mark id="163">I think the odds are better than 50-50 that the Windows killer-- or more accurately, Windows transcender-- will come from some little startup.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="167">Another classic way to make something people want is to take a luxury and make it into a commmodity.</mark> <mark id="166">People must want something if they pay a lot for it.</mark> <mark id="165">And it is a very rare product that can't be made dramatically cheaper if you try.</mark></p>
<p>This was Henry Ford's plan. <mark id="171">He made cars, which had been a luxury item, into a commodity.</mark> <mark id="170">But the idea is much older than Henry Ford.</mark> <mark id="169">Water mills transformed mechanical power from a luxury into a commodity, and they were used in the Roman empire.</mark> <mark id="168">Arguably pastoralism transformed a luxury into a commodity.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="174">When you make something cheaper you can sell more of them.</mark> <mark id="173">But if you make something dramatically cheaper you often get qualitative changes, because people start to use it in different ways.</mark> <mark id="172">For example, once computers get so cheap that most people can have one of their own, you can use them as communication devices.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="178">Often to make something dramatically cheaper you have to redefine the problem.</mark> <mark id="177">The Model T didn't have all the features previous cars did.</mark> <mark id="176">It only came in black, for example.</mark> <mark id="175">But it solved the problem people cared most about, which was getting from place to place.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="182">One of the most useful mental habits I know I learned from Michael Rabin: that the best way to solve a problem is often to redefine it.</mark> <mark id="181">A lot of people use this technique without being consciously aware of it, but Rabin was spectacularly explicit.</mark> You need a big prime number? Those are pretty expensive. <mark id="180">How about if I give you a big number that only has a 10 to the minus 100 chance of not being prime?</mark> Would that do? <mark id="179">Well, probably; I mean, that's probably smaller than the chance that I'm imagining all this anyway.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="185">Redefining the problem is a particularly juicy heuristic when you have competitors, because it's so hard for rigid-minded people to follow.</mark> <mark id="184">You can work in plain sight and they don't realize the danger.</mark> Don't worry about us. We're just working on search. <mark id="183">Do one thing and do it well, that's our motto.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="187">Making things cheaper is actually a subset of a more general technique: making things easier.</mark> <mark id="186">For a long time it was most of making things easier, but now that the things we build are so complicated, there's another rapidly growing subset: making things easier to <i>use</i>.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="189">This is an area where there's great room for improvement.</mark> <mark id="188">What you want to be able to say about technology is: it just works.</mark> How often do you say that now?</p>
<p><mark id="198">Simplicity takes effort-- genius, even.</mark> <mark id="197">The average programmer seems to produce UI designs that are almost willfully bad.</mark> <mark id="196">I was trying to use the stove at my mother's house a couple weeks ago.</mark> <mark id="195">It was a new one, and instead of physical knobs it had buttons and an LED display.</mark> <mark id="194">I tried pressing some buttons I thought would cause it to get hot, and you know what it said?</mark> <mark id="193">"Err." Not even "Error." "Err." You can't just say "Err" to the user of a <i>stove</i>.</mark> <mark id="192">You should design the UI so that errors are impossible.</mark> <mark id="191">And the boneheads who designed this stove even had an example of such a UI to work from: the old one.</mark> <mark id="190">You turn one knob to set the temperature and another to set the timer.</mark> What was wrong with that? It just worked.</p>
<p><mark id="200">It seems that, for the average engineer, more options just means more rope to hang yourself.</mark> <mark id="199">So if you want to start a startup, you can take almost any existing technology produced by a big company, and assume you could build something way easier to use.</mark></p>
<p><b>Design for Exit</b></p>
<p><mark id="203">Success for a startup approximately equals getting bought.</mark> <mark id="202">You need some kind of exit strategy, because you can't get the smartest people to work for you without giving them options likely to be worth something.</mark> <mark id="201">Which means you either have to get bought or go public, and the number of startups that go public is very small.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="206">If success probably means getting bought, should you make that a conscious goal?</mark> <mark id="205">The old answer was no: you were supposed to pretend that you wanted to create a giant, public company, and act surprised when someone made you an offer.</mark> Really, you want to buy us? <mark id="204">Well, I suppose we'd consider it, for the right price.</mark></p>
<p>I think things are changing. <mark id="210">If 98% of the time success means getting bought, why not be open about it?</mark> <mark id="209">If 98% of the time you're doing product development on spec for some big company, why not think of that as your task?</mark> <mark id="208">One advantage of this approach is that it gives you another source of ideas: look at big companies, think what they <a href="http://kiko.com">should</a> be doing, and do it yourself.</mark> <mark id="207">Even if they already know it, you'll probably be done faster.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="214">Just be sure to make something multiple acquirers will want.</mark> <mark id="213">Don't fix Windows, because the only potential acquirer is Microsoft, and when there's only one acquirer, they don't have to hurry.</mark> <mark id="212">They can take their time and copy you instead of buying you.</mark> <mark id="211">If you want to get market price, work on something where there's competition.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="217">If an increasing number of startups are created to do product development on spec, it will be a natural counterweight to monopolies.</mark> <mark id="216">Once some type of technology is captured by a monopoly, it will only evolve at big company rates instead of startup rates, whereas alternatives will evolve with especial speed.</mark> <mark id="215">A free market interprets monopoly as damage and routes around it.</mark></p>
<p><b>The Woz Route</b></p>
<p><mark id="222">The most productive way to generate startup ideas is also the most unlikely-sounding: by accident.</mark> <mark id="221">If you look at how famous startups got started, a lot of them weren't initially supposed to be startups.</mark> <mark id="220">Lotus began with a program Mitch Kapor wrote for a friend.</mark> <mark id="219">Apple got started because Steve Wozniak wanted to build microcomputers, and his employer, Hewlett-Packard, wouldn't let him do it at work.</mark> <mark id="218">Yahoo began as David Filo's personal collection of links.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="227">This is not the only way to start startups.</mark> <mark id="226">You can sit down and consciously come up with an idea for a company; we did.</mark> <mark id="225">But measured in total market cap, the build-stuff-for-yourself model might be more fruitful.</mark> <mark id="224">It certainly has to be the most fun way to come up with startup ideas.</mark> <mark id="223">And since a startup ought to have multiple founders who were already friends before they decided to start a company, the rather surprising conclusion is that the best way to generate startup ideas is to do what hackers do for fun: cook up amusing hacks with your friends.</mark></p>
<p><mark id="228">It seems like it violates some kind of conservation law, but there it is: the best way to get a "million dollar idea" is just to do what hackers enjoy doing anyway.</mark></p>

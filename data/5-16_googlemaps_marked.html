 <b>
  The entire concept of a "map" seems radically different from even a decade ago.
 </b>
</span>
<span class="marker" id="4">
 It used to be something in a book or on a wall; now it's something you carry around on your smartphone.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="3">
 Which changes have mattered most?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="2">
 And what further changes should we be ready for?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="6">
 The major change in mapping in the past decade, as opposed to in the previous 6,000 to 10,000 years, is that mapping has become personal.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="12">
 It's not the map itself that has changed.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="11">
 You would recognize a 1940 map and the latest, modern Google map as having almost the same look.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="10">
 But the old map was a fixed piece of paper, the same for everybody who looked at it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="9">
 The new map is different for everyone who uses it.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="8">
 You can drag it where you want to go, you can zoom in as you wish, you can switch modes--traffic, satellite---you can fly across your town, even ask questions about restaurants and directions.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="7">
 So a map has gone from a static, stylized portrait of the Earth to a dynamic, inter-active conversation about your use of the Earth.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="marker" id="13">
 I think that's officially the Big Change, and it's already happened, rather than being ahead.
</span>
</p>
<br>
 <br>
  <p>
<b>
 So what might still happen?
</b>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="15">
 The dialogue with the map is becoming much more personal.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="14">
 You can imagine that in the future, if you have a wearable computer, the dialogue will become even more intimate: you will see a continuous stream of guidance and information, and no one else will even know that you're being advised.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="17">
 For instance, right now people walk around looking at directions on phones.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="16">
 In the future, the phone will signal you--go left or straight ahead--in words or sounds in your ear, or
</span>   <br>
<span class="marker" id="26">
 visually through your glasses, so you can just look where you're going and walk.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="25">
 It'll be like you're a local everywhere you go.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="24">
 You'll know your way through the back alleys and hutongs of Beijing, you'll know your way all around Paris even if you've never been before.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="23">
 Signs will seem to translate themselves for you.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="22">
 This kind of extra-smartness is coming to people.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="21">
 Effectively, people are about 20 IQ points smarter now because of Google Search and Maps.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="20">
 They don't give Google credit for it, which is fine; they think they're smarter, because they can rely on these tools.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="19">
 It's one reason they get so upset if the tools are inaccurate or let them down.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="18">
 They feel like a fifth of their brain has been taken out.
</span>
   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="27">
 <b>
  Isn't this just like the voice in the car GPS telling you, annoyingly, where to turn?
 </b>
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
It's more.
<span class="marker" id="32">
 The Google "geo" team grew from two seeds---Keyhole, which led to Google Earth, and two brothers who founded what is now Google Maps.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="31">
 We've worked to invent the most comprehensive, authoritative, useful mapping solutions that humans can build, and I think we've been pretty successful at that.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="30">
 So I would consider this like Dr.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="29">
 Johnson's compilation of a dictionary of the English language, or maybe the rise of the encyclopedia.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="28">
 It's the creation of a universal reference work, reflecting a lot of labor and great expense, that everybody can rely on.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
If you think about Dr.
<span class="marker" id="35">
 Johnson's dictionary from the point of view of English literature, you might say, "Well, Johnson--he did a dictionary." But what else could you do with words on a piece of paper?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="34">
 Maybe you could write mysteries, or comedy, or adventure stories.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="33">
 You can do a lot of things with the words in his dictionary.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="38">
 We think there will be a new literature from the mapping dictionary that's now being built.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="37">
 There's an Android app we've released called Field Trip.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="36">
 You download it, and it says, "I don't want to bother you, so how often should I talk to you?" You tell it "all the time" or "rarely" or whatever, and then you turn off your phone and put it in your pocket and don't think about it again.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="42">
 Then when you're walking around, say in Washington, D.C., the phone will buzz and say, "You are 25 feet from an accurate map of 2,700 solar objects.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="41">
 If you go over there to the Einstein Memorial, you can see them." Or you might be walking down the street and it will beep and say, "The rowhouse one block to the left is the No.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="40">
 1-rated Greek restaurant within 500 miles," or maybe: "Around the corner behind you is where a scene from your favorite movie was filmed." It is using your location to search in a database of "interesting things," and it learns what kinds of things you care about.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="39">
 It means having your life enlightened by travel knowledge, every-where, or getting to walk around with local experts who know your tastes, wherever in the world you go.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="46">
 We've already seen this transition in mobile maps.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="45">
 All those fears and anxieties in travel--what happens if I get lost someplace where I don't speak the language?
</span>
<span class="marker" id="44">
 If you have a mobile phone with Google Maps, you can go anywhere on the planet and have confidence that we can give you directions to get to where you want to go safely and easily.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="43">
 No human ever has to feel lost again.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="48">
 <b>
  You travel the world, talking with governments and citizens about the implications of mapping.
 </b>
</span>
<span class="marker" id="47">
 What has surprised you about the effects of this technology that you and your colleagues helped create?
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="54">
 For me, as an engineer, the concept of "political truth" among some governments remains alien.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="53">
 For instance, our maps show that there is a dispute about whether a body of water should be called the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Gulf.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="52">
 We draw a borderline in yellow if that's where neighboring nations agree it should be.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="51">
 We draw it in red if there's disagreement.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="50">
 Some governments are so devoted to their version of reality that they are outraged that we report that there is a dispute.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="49">
 I find that brittleness unexpected.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="58">
 A better surprise has to do with the interest of people in geography.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="57">
 Geography was a class that few embraced in school.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="56">
 In elementary school, they make you color in maps to show where the oceans and continents are.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="55">
 And yet, when we were starting Keyhole, we read a report that one-fifth of American elementary-school students couldn't point out the Pacific Ocean on a map.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
We thought, "This is wrong.
<span class="marker" id="62">
 We're going to fix this problem.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="61">
 We're going to make learning about the Earth fun, instead of boring." We were saying, "No, we're not going to make a game out of the Earth, but we are going to make discovering the Earth a joy"--like you're dating a planet and you want to know it, to hear all about its past and hopes.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="60">
 That's what we did: we made something immersive and engaging and personal.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="59">
 You can fly to your home--fly to your parents' home--and remember the time you snuck out in the backyard and did something you shouldn't do, or the place where you had a first kiss, or the place you got married.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="64">
 What we didn't expect was how many people would share that joy with us.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="63">
 A billion people have installed Google Earth on their computer.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="65">
 Whenever people complain about Google Maps and Google Earth, they ask, "Why is my backyard blurry?" or "Why is that tree still there, even though we cut it down last year?" They're angry that it's not a perfect planetary mirror, when eight years ago only a few of us even imagined it was possible.

 <b>
  Looking at the huge changes in mapping over the past decade, which parts were hardest, from a technical view?
 </b>
</span>
<span class="marker" id="66">
 I'm wondering which were most "magical" from the perspective of those of you on the inside, versus what those on the outside might notice when we turn on our computers or smartphones.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="68">
 Well, there are technical advances that people probably don't even realize were new and different.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="71">
 For example, here at Google, we invented the notion of an interactive online map that you can drag on the screen.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="70">
 MapQuest invented the idea of clicking on buttons to go north, south, east, and west.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="69">
 We had the idea of moving smoothly, and I think that is probably the most copied patent in the world at this point.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="73">
 I think the notion of seeing the Earth in imagery is something that secret spy agencies and generals in the military have always liked doing.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="72">
 But as far as everybody doing that--being able to see where the hotel is, find out if it's really on the beach, or looking at houses to see whether they're close to a neighborhood park or churches--that notion that we could bring the entire planet to every human is a pretty big change.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="77">
 Accessing that technology was actually a political accomplishment.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="76">
 President Clinton signed a bill to approve satellites for commercial use.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="75">
 That was a democratization of images of the planet that we took advantage of to say, "Hey, we can buy pictures now.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="74">
 Let's set up a company to make these pictures available to everybody."
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="84">
 Of course, there was also the rise of the smartphone.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="83">
 I would say that what makes smartphones smart, in large measure, is their sense of location.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="82">
 Their awareness of your location becomes a part of any question you ask--an implicit part of the question--and that makes them able to seem insightful, because they can tell you about restaurants near you, and taxicabs near you, and even traffic jams near you.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="81">
 You don't have to tell them where you are; they know where you are.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="80">
 They're smart in that sense, and that's only possible because of the GPS system up in the sky, because of known locations of Wi-Fi devices located all around the world.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="79">
 These are technologies that play together to make this new possibility happen.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="78">
 Putting it all together seemed a hard thing.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="87">
 <b>
  I'd like to ask about a different kind of sociopolitical consequence of the new kinds of mapping.
 </b>
</span>
<span class="marker" id="86">
 People say that the first-ever photo of the entire Earth, from space, created a different kind of environmental consciousness.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="85">
 Do you think that the current revolution in mapping and views of the Earth will have any similar effect?
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<a href="editor-content.html?cs=utf-8" name="_GoBack">

My father is in his 80s.
<span class="marker" id="91">
 He wanted to know more about what I do, so I recently showed him
 <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/gallery.html#!/ocean">
  Google's underwater Street View
 </a>
 .
</span>
<span class="marker" id="90">
 [This is an aspect of Google Earth that shows reefs, seamounts, and other underwater features in the oceans.] We dove in the water and we were basically swimming along.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="89">
 We stopped and zoomed in, looked at turtles, looked at fish.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="88">
 We went down under a big reef and we could see a tunnel in there, and there were fish resting in the tunnel.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="93">
 After a while he said, "Son, this is so beautiful." He's never been scuba diving, but he said, "This is so beautiful.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="92">
 I just can't believe how beautiful this is." And I said, "Well, Dad, we chose beautiful places because most of the corals near islands around the world are already dead.
</span>
They look like old concrete. No fish, just dead."
  </p>
  <p>
He almost cried.
<span class="marker" id="97">
 He stared at me with a "What has the world come to?" kind of look, and we talked for a while about that.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="96">
 And so he was brought to an awareness of the grotesque damage that's happening worldwide due to the ocean acidification that follows from the externalities of the way we live as a human race right now.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="95">
 It was powerful for him because he could personally experience the ocean in a way that, with his mobility challenges, he's never going to see by scuba diving.
</span>
<span class="marker" id="94">
 Yet he felt what people who have experienced the sea know to be true and care about.
</span>
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="marker" id="98">
 I believe that only this kind of understanding leads to activism, whether it's a passive activism of a vote or an active activism of changing your lifestyle to protect the world.
